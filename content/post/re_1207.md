# Abstract

* How can the plastic mass balance of an urban area be modelled using Material Flow Analysis?
* Developing a generic framework, which includes eight consumption sectors, three distinguishable littering processes and two subsystems (surface water system and soil)
* A bottom-up approach is applied and the municipality of Leiden in the Netherlands is used as a case study.
* The biggest plastic flows are packaging flows (4146 t), plastics in building waste (1342 t) and plastics in End-of-life transportation systems (570 t). The highest plastic stocks are in buildings (86080 t), transportation (14020 t) and electronics devices (10326 t).

# 2 Theory

## 2.1 MATERIAL FLOW ANALYSIS

### 2.1.1 MATERIAL FLOW ANALYSIS STUDIES ON PLASTIC FLOWS
* Only little research tried to assess plastic flows on the regional level.
* Many analysis lacks stock assessment.
