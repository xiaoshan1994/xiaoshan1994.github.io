## Abstract

*  Implementation of circular technologies in the plastics supply chain: {{< hl-text orange>}}(i) chemical and mechanical recycling, (ii) biomass utilization, and (iii) carbon capture and utilization (CCU)—to exchange the fossil carbon feedstock{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Our study shows that by combining recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU, net-zero GHG emission plastics could be achieved with lower energy demands and lower operational costs than those associated with current fossil-based production technologies combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS).
* We built and used a global bottom-up model for plastics production and waste treatment based on {{< hl-text blue>}}>400, mostly industrially validated, life-cycle assessment compliant and harmonized technology datasets{{< /hl-text >}} representing the life cycle of >90% of global plastics.
* We project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* Two scenarios for fossil-based plastic waste treatment: landfilling and energy recovery (**represented by the linear carbon pathway**).

Fig. 1. Potential reductions of global GHG emissions of plastics by four circular pathways in 2050.(A) Reductions of life-cycle GHG emissions from “cradle-to-grave” of the four pathways—recycling (Rec.), biomass (Bio), carbon capture and utilization (CCU), and the circular carbon pathway (Optimal)—{{< hl-text orange>}}depending on the {{< hl-text blue>}}electricity carbon footprint{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /hl-text >}}. av., average. (B) Remaining GHG emissions of the linear carbon pathways and the four circular pathways, {{< hl-text orange>}}depending on the {{< hl-text blue>}}carbon intensity of electricity{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /hl-text >}}. The GHG emissions of the linear carbon pathway are not altered as a result of decreased electricity climate impacts, because all electricity is supplied from the energy recovery via plastic waste incineration. (C) Optimal carbon input in percentage of the circular carbon pathway, depending on the carbon intensity of electricity. The IEA report (28) provides only regionalized electricity impacts until 2040. (D) Feedstock supply and waste treatment of the circular carbon pathway for wind-based electricity production with 7 g of CO2-equiv per kWh. Line width and corresponding values represent the carbon content (million tons of C) of the flows.

* Overall, plastics solely based on recycling, biomass utilization, or CCU fail to reach net-zero GHG emissions, even for wind-based electricity production.
* Even recycling rates are maximized, all recycling processes produce residual wastes, leading to GHG emissions.
* Biomass cultivation emits noncarbon GHGs (e.g. nitrous oxide) that co2 uptake cannot counterbalance.
* Even in the most ambitious scenarios of the IEA, renewable electricity production is not entirely net zero by 2050, with ~13.5 g of CO2-equiv per kWh.
* The unavoidable emission in the optimal circular pathway is caused by landfilling (permanent carbon storage in landfills).
* Technologies and carbon feedstocks that minimize GHG emissions of plastics depend on the {{< hl-text blue>}}electricity supply's carbon intensity{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Break-even points for the carbon footprint of electricity supple: CCU becomes climate beneficial compared with the recycling (39.5g of co2-equiv per kWh) and biomass (5.8g of co2-equiv per kWh) pathways.
* Over 8.6 g of CO2-equiv per kWh, the optimal pathway is solely based on biomass and plastic waste as carbon feedstock.

## Renewable resource demands

Fig. 2. Demand for biomass and electricity to achieve net-zero emission plastics in 2050. Data for the circular carbon pathway are shown together with those for the linear carbon and recycling pathways with CCS. The range of CCS reflects different sources of CO2, such as ammonia plants (34) or ambient air (35). The energy demands for the linear carbon scenarios are based on fossil resources, which are converted to biomass and electricity on an energy basis. The marker annotated with “Fig. 1D” refers to the Sankey diagram in Fig. 1. In both cases, the same amount of electricity and biomass are used.

* The resource demands can be shifted between biomass and renewable electricity because both CCU and biomass can achieve net-zero emission plastics in combination with recycling.
* 2.7 PWh of electricity is assumed to be supplied to plastics life cycles as plastic production accounts for ~80% of the overall mass of the major bulk chemicals.
* Only sufficient plastic waste is collected and made available that promising recycling technologies at low technology readiness levels (chemical recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU technologies) can leverage their potential.
* Landfill bans have proven highly effective in EU countries e.g. Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, while a proper waste management infrastructure is missing in many low- and middle-income countries.
* To gain access to these untapped resources, we should increase the {{< hl-text blue>}}profitability of material recycling{{< /hl-text >}} through investments in waste management infrastructure and {{< hl-text blue>}}improved coordination for collection, sorting and management of plastic wastes{{< /hl-text >}}.

## Policies for circular and net-zero emission plastics

* Two crucial technological changes achieving net-zero emission plastics: {{< hl-text orange>}}(i) increase plastic recycling rates and supply more plastic waste feedstock,{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text orange>}}(ii) deploy CCU or biomass technologies, depending on local availabilities of renewable electricity and biomass.{{< /hl-text >}}
* Current EU ETSs exclude end-of-life management processes such as {{< hl-text blue>}}incineration{{< /hl-text >}} from the scope. {{< hl-text orange>}}Including plastic waste incineration in emission pricing schemes{{< /hl-text >}} through, e.g., {{< hl-text blue>}}extended producer responsibility{{< /hl-text >}} policy would be a step forward to incentivize recycling. {{< hl-text orange>}}The entire life cycle of plastics must be covered within the scope of carbon pricing.{{< /hl-text >}}
* [{{< hl-text blue>}}A deposit system {{< /hl-text >}}](https://plasticseurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2018-Plastics-the-facts.pdf)for plastic materials could provide a potential avenue for consumers to provide valuable plastic waste feedstock directly from the start.
* Compared to subsidy in oil exploration and production of fossil products, low return on investment of renewable carbon feedstocks including plastic waste and biomass.
* Balance with other environmental impacts of large-scale usage of biomass (terrestrial acidification[^eac] and water eutrophication) and renewable electricity (metal depletion and water consumption for solar and wind-based power plants).

# Life cycle environmental impacts of chemical recycling via pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste in comparison with mechanical recycling and energy recovery

## 1. Introduction
* Currently only one-third of post-consumer plastic waste in Europe is collected for recycling, with the majority (43%) incinerated in waste-to-energy plants; the rest is still landfilled (PlasticsEurope, 2019).
* Plastics can be recycled using either mechanical or chemical recycling technologies.
* Mechanical recycling involves sorting, washing, shredding and melting of plastic waste to produce granulate and finally new plastic products (Ragaert et al., 2017). The main disadvantage is that the process can degrade the mechanical properties of plastic materials, meaning the mixed plastic waste is usually 'down-cycled' into secondary and less valuable products. Inefficient for difficult-to-recycle plastics, e.g. multi-layered or heterogeneous plastic used. It still leaves residual materials to be incinerated or landfilled.

### CO2 supply

Three options: 1) co2 supply from chemical and plastic production, e.g. capturing co2 from ammonia, ethylene oxide, hydrogen-producing plants, and biomass fermentation and gasification. 2) capturing CO2 from waste incinerators for production residuals and plastic wastes. 3) capturing CO2 directly from ambient air. Fossil based power plants are excluded.

### Biomass supply

Foucusing on lignocellulosic feedstock: wood chips (木屑), bark chips (树皮片), wood pellets (木屑颗粒)， miscanthus (芒草), or sugarcane bagasse (甘蔗渣). {{< hl-text orange>}}GHG emissions for the lignocellulose feedstock were taken from ecoinvent 3.6 and {{< hl-text orange>}}corrected by the uptake of biogenic CO2{{< /hl-text >}}.

### End-of-life technologies

Three options exist to treat plastic waste: landfilling, incineration (e.g., energy recovery), and recycling.

[^eac]: Acidification is where the pH level of soil decreases and reduces plant vigour. While soil acidification is a natural process (especially in higher rainfall regions), agricultural practices can greatly accelerate the rate of acidification.
