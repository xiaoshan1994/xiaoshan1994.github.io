## Highlights
* Environmental impacts of {{< hl-text blue>}}EOL treatments{{< /hl-text >}} were assessed based on the components and treatment pattern of waste plastics.
* EOL treatments of waste plastics bring environmental benefits to China.
* **Mechanical recycling** plays the most beneficial role in EOL treatments.
* Scenarios are set to analyze the potential reduction of environmental impacts for waste plastics.

## Abstract

*  Implementation of circular technologies in the plastics supply chain: {{< hl-text orange>}}(i) chemical and mechanical recycling, (ii) biomass utilization, and (iii) carbon capture and utilization (CCU)—to exchange the fossil carbon feedstock{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Our study shows that by combining recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU, net-zero GHG emission plastics could be achieved with lower energy demands and lower operational costs than those associated with current fossil-based production technologies combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS).
* We built and used a global bottom-up model for plastics production and waste treatment based on {{< hl-text blue>}}>400, mostly industrially validated, life-cycle assessment compliant and harmonized technology datasets{{< /hl-text >}} representing the life cycle of >90% of global plastics.
* We project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* Two scenarios for fossil-based plastic waste treatment: landfilling and energy recovery (**represented by the linear carbon pathway**).

Fig. 1. Potential reductions of global GHG emissions of plastics by four circular pathways in 2050.(A) Reductions of life-cycle GHG emissions from “cradle-to-grave” of the four pathways—recycling (Rec.), biomass (Bio), carbon capture and utilization (CCU), and the circular carbon pathway (Optimal)—{{< hl-text orange>}}depending on the {{< hl-text blue>}}electricity carbon footprint{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /hl-text >}}. av., average. (B) Remaining GHG emissions of the linear carbon pathways and the four circular pathways, {{< hl-text orange>}}depending on the {{< hl-text blue>}}carbon intensity of electricity{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /hl-text >}}. The GHG emissions of the linear carbon pathway are not altered as a result of decreased electricity climate impacts, because all electricity is supplied from the energy recovery via plastic waste incineration. (C) Optimal carbon input in percentage of the circular carbon pathway, depending on the carbon intensity of electricity. The IEA report (28) provides only regionalized electricity impacts until 2040. (D) Feedstock supply and waste treatment of the circular carbon pathway for wind-based electricity production with 7 g of CO2-equiv per kWh. Line width and corresponding values represent the carbon content (million tons of C) of the flows.

* Overall, plastics solely based on recycling, biomass utilization, or CCU fail to reach net-zero GHG emissions, even for wind-based electricity production.
