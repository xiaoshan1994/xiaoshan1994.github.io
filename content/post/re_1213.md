# Introduction
We produce each day a lot of {{< hl-text blue>}}takeaway waste{{< /hl-text >}}. {{< hl-text blue>}}Oneway packaging{{< /hl-text >}} is the standard.
* How does the university handle this? Do they {{< hl-text blue>}}recycle or dispose{{< /hl-text >}}?
* What is the {{< hl-text blue>}}environmental impact{{< /hl-text >}}?
* How much does this {{< hl-text blue>}}cost{{< /hl-text >}}?
* What would be the benefits of a {{< hl-text blue>}}no waste policy{{< /hl-text >}}?
* Could avoiding takeaway trash be a profound argument to implement {{< hl-text blue>}}a reusable food & beverage packaging system{{< /hl-text >}}?

# Background and research questions
***Environmental policy plan for 2016-2020*** contains graph with tonnes of waste per type. 700 tonnes per year in 2012-2014. Plan university: prevent, separate, recycle.
https://issuu.com/universiteit-leiden/docs/duurzaamheidsverslag_2020 Report reflecting on the policy plan.

In 2020 the university produced 40% less residual waste than in 2019. The separation of different waste flows is encouraged by having our own recycling centers at the larger university locations. 850 tons of waste per year, 45% of which is separated to be recycled. Average amount of waste (kg): grey = residual waste, blue = paper and cardboard.

Note: Drop in 2020 largely due to covid-19.

“PBT and PET are sensitive to hot water above 60 °C (140 °F). PBT and PET need UV protection if used outdoors, and most grades of these polyesters are flammable, although additives can be used to improve both UV and flammability properties.” https://bioplasticsnews.com/polybutylene-terephthalate-pbt/

Problematic if we want to use this? How do we wash this? And if additives improve this, how does that affect the recyclability? (this usually makes the process difficult.)
<-- it emerges as a key issue, since the products by reCircle are all made out of PBT (Plastic.pdf), {{< hl-text orange>}}is university gonna integrate products that are not 100% re-usable/eco-friendly? To what extent university wants to get an envrionment firendly waste management (like 100% or how much?)?{{< /hl-text >}}

--> this relates also to the recycle procedures they aim to:
pure plastic products can be recycled --> however, there are no official collection routes and no official recycling procedure --> our producer, Stefan Kälin AG, we can regranulate the reCIRCLE BOXes, i.e. shred them, and thus produce new granulate for reuse.
Unfortunately, we cannot currently use this granulate for new reCIRCLE BOXes for legal reasons. We want to change this and are in contact with the responsible authorities, so that old reCIRCLE BOXes will soon become new reCIRCLE BOXes (Plastic.pdf)

--> what is the core idea of reCircle’s recycling procedure? Without having specific details on it and its environmental costs, it is hard for the university to make an agreement.
Clarification needed: What’s the difference between using reCircle products and bringing my own containers to get my take-away food/drinks?! (what are the real advantages?),,,

ReCIRCLE has a 5-year history in Switzerland and Germany. Can we use experiences from companies and universities there to improve the image of reCIRCLE? (experiences like savings, pros/cons etc.)
