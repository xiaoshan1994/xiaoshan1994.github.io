# Introduction
We produce each day a lot of {{< hl-text blue>}}takeaway waste{{< /hl-text >}}. {{< hl-text blue>}}Oneway packaging{{< /hl-text >}} is the standard.
* How does the university handle this? Do they {{< hl-text blue>}}recycle or dispose{{< /hl-text >}}?
* What is the {{< hl-text blue>}}environmental impact{{< /hl-text >}}?
* How much does this {{< hl-text blue>}}cost{{< /hl-text >}}?
* What would be the benefits of a {{< hl-text blue>}}no waste policy{{< /hl-text >}}?
* Could avoiding takeaway trash be a profound argument to implement {{< hl-text blue>}}a reusable food & beverage packaging system{{< /hl-text >}}?

# Background and research questions
***Environmental policy plan for 2016-2020*** contains graph with tonnes of waste per type. 700 tonnes per year in 2012-2014. Plan university: prevent, separate, recycle.
https://issuu.com/universiteit-leiden/docs/duurzaamheidsverslag_2020 Report reflecting on the policy plan.

In 2020 the university produced 40% less residual waste than in 2019. The separation of different waste flows is encouraged by having our own recycling centers at the larger university locations. 850 tons of waste per year, 45% of which is separated to be recycled. Average amount of waste (kg): grey = residual waste, blue = paper and cardboard.

Note: Drop in 2020 largely due to covid-19.

“PBT and PET are sensitive to hot water above 60 °C (140 °F). PBT and PET need UV protection if used outdoors, and most grades of these polyesters are flammable, although additives can be used to improve both UV and flammability properties.” https://bioplasticsnews.com/polybutylene-terephthalate-pbt/

Problematic if we want to use this? How do we wash this? And if additives improve this, how does that affect the recyclability? (this usually makes the process difficult.)
<-- it emerges as a key issue, since the products by reCircle are all made out of PBT (Plastic.pdf), {{< hl-text orange>}}is university gonna integrate products that are not 100% re-usable/eco-friendly? To what extent university wants to get an envrionment firendly waste management (like 100% or how much?)?{{< /hl-text >}}

--> this relates also to the recycle procedures they aim to:
pure plastic products can be recycled --> however, there are no official collection routes and no official recycling procedure --> our producer, Stefan Kälin AG, we can regranulate the reCIRCLE BOXes, i.e. shred them, and thus produce new granulate for reuse.
Unfortunately, we cannot currently use this granulate for new reCIRCLE BOXes for legal reasons. We want to change this and are in contact with the responsible authorities, so that old reCIRCLE BOXes will soon become new reCIRCLE BOXes (Plastic.pdf)

--> what is the core idea of reCircle’s recycling procedure? Without having specific details on it and its environmental costs, it is hard for the university to make an agreement.
Clarification needed: What’s the difference between using reCircle products and bringing my own containers to get my take-away food/drinks?! (what are the real advantages?),,,

ReCIRCLE has a 5-year history in Switzerland and Germany. Can we use experiences from companies and universities there to improve the image of reCIRCLE? (experiences like savings, pros/cons etc.)

https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/dossiers/the-sustainable-university/waste Sums up the environmental policy plan + what should happen to every waste flow

We could contact the UFB to ask for information or data

Potential Research Questions:
Will extra dishes influence water use and pollution due to intensive use of dishwashers?
Do people actively decide if they use a paper cup or a ceramic bowl?
What fraction of the users of university cafeterias use disposable items?
-	Can we make sure people don't use single use items when they plan to stay at campus?
Are people willing to pay 10 euros deposit for a cup/bowl?
Is the university cafeteria a fitting environment for reCIRCLE-boxes? // Is it possible to create the reCircle points at university? Where and how could we plan this?

We can go two ways: behaviour/thoughts of people or the emissions and technicallities of the product compared to the current system

Behavioural:
•	Do people actively decide if they use a paper cup or ceramic bowl
•	What fraction of the users of the university cafeterias uses disposable items?
•	Are people willing to pay 10 euros deposit for a cup/bowl
•	*Is the university cafeteria a fitting environment for the reCIRCLE-boxes?

Technicalities:
•	Will extra dishes influence water use and pollution due to intensive use of dishwashers?
•	^+LCA-stuff?
•	Is it possible to create reCIRCLE points at university?
•	*Is the university cafeteria a fitting environment for the reCIRCLE-boxes?

# Plenary progress meeting

Introduction:
In our project, our focus is on Leiden University’s waste management process and ReCIRCLE. ReCIRCLE is a company that offers {{< hl-text blue>}}reusable plastic containers and cups{{< /hl-text >}} rather than single use packaging such as disposable paper soup cups. The containers are reclaimed after use, reducing total waste from packaging. After having the meeting with our commissioner Owe, we can see that the issue is whether or not Leiden University should make a transition to cooperating with ReCircle to address its waste management. Owe basically wants to know how well LU is doing regarding waste management and if reCIRCLE and LU could be potential partners in the near future. As it stands, Leiden University uses recycling bins and disposable single use products to address its waste concerns, separating waste into 5 flows: biodegradable waste and food remains; paper and cardboard; PMD (plastic packaging material, cans and metals); paper cups; and residual waste. By looking at how efficiently the current system is working, we can explore if partnership with ReCIRCLE is a realistic option for Leiden University.

RQ's
We might be able to do an attempt to research the different waste flows too. -> Activity on university needed for this, so depending on covid situation. Otherwise, we'd have to do this with information provided by the university and UFB.
-	Suggestion:
Collect some bins and check if everything is deposited in the right bin / Interview people to find out if they understand where they should deposit which items.

Methods

We have gathered general data on the waste management of Leiden University through the environmental policy plan 2016-2020 and the reports by the Leiden University Green Office. The information found is still too generic and precise details on the take-away packaging materials, costs, and waste amount are missing.

For this reason, we are currently planning to interview people and verify to what extent people know where they should deposit which items. We aim to reach out the catering team of university's cafeteria and we would like to directly test by checking the bins and whether every item is deposited in its right waste category.

# About reCIRCLE

n innovation of food-package-sharing pattern. Customers pay for a deposit for the reCIRCLE container or cup when enjoying their takeaway food or beverage. You return the container and get the refund or a new container at one of their networks after you finished your food. Those replaced products will be recycled directly by their producers.

# Meeting with the commissioner
There is a ongoing project conducted by IE master students.
