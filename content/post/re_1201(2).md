* limitation: 1. Estimating Linear extrapolation of past changes at the country level; 2. No heterogeneity within a nation; 3. Landscape configuration and context are ignored.
* Linking LCA with land-use change modelling and spatially explicit ecosystem services modelling.
* Case study: impact of 3 production volumes of high-demand bio-based, high-density polyethylene(DHPE, made of maize and sugarcane).
