# Highlights
* A transferable residential space heating energy model is developed based on geo-referenced data and archetypes.
* Model results are spatially validated against measured energy consumption.
* Past refurbishment and occupant behaviour significantly affect model results.
* The model is suited to identify spatial hotspots and assess energy-efficiency measures.
