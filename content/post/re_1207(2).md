* A national plastic footprint consists of the sum of domestic plastic pollution that serves domestic consumption and foreign plastic pollution that serves consumption in that particular country.
* For example, carbon footprints account for the environmental impacts of various emissions
(CO2, methane, N2O, CFC, etc.) expressed in CO2 equivalent.
