# Executive summary
> Current LCAs (Life Cycle Assessment) do not account for plastic as a pollutant. LCAs assume 100% collection of waste streams go to landfill, incineration or recycling.

# Key foundings
1. Existing methodologies focus on assessment of plastic usage, waste or recycling
rates, with little focus on circularity. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and circularity should be used synergistically to identify the best scenarios in terms of reducing environmental impacts while aiming to maximise circularity. Furthermore, stakeholders should be encouraged to use {{< hl-text blue>}}metrics based on leakage/inventory rather than using only recycling rates{{< /hl-text >}}.
2. While several projects are aiming to develop an inventory approach to assess leakage for both macroplastics and microplastics, they are not yet available for use. Performing a generic plastic footprint based on such methodologies seems to be achievable in the short term, but significant challenges must be overcome {{< hl-text blue>}}to develop a more specific methodology that could support eco-design strategies{{< /hl-text >}}.
3. There is an acute lack of data to allow for impact assessment and to embed plastic impacts within LCA frameworks. Plastic footprints currently in development propose to include fate in their {{< hl-text orange>}}calculations to account for different {{< hl-text blue>}}residence times{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}biodegradability rates{{< /hl-text >}} for different plastics{{< /hl-text >}}.

The move towards a single indicator, such as a monetary valuation metric, could help weigh the cost of inaction on plastic waste and leakage with other potential actions. Such an approach would not only provide monetary information on the impacts caused by plastic leakage but also on the return on investment of mitigation and
remediation measures.

Based on the key findings of this report, IUCN is working in collaboration with UN Environment and the scientific community to develop a best-in-class plastic hotspot methodology that can provide key stakeholders with data and analysis needed to inform their decision-making on reducing plastic leakage.

# 1. Introduction

* A national plastic footprint consists of the sum of domestic plastic pollution that serves domestic consumption and foreign plastic pollution that serves consumption in that particular country.
* For example, carbon footprints account for the environmental impacts of various emissions
(CO2, methane, N2O, CFC, etc.) expressed in CO2 equivalent.
