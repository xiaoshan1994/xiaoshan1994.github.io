* How such **local-scale patterns of decision-making can be used to explain land-use change globally** is unknown.
* Using a collection of local studies from a literature review, we studied the contextual conditions of different modes of land-use change decision-making and present global maps of the potential **distribution of decision-making in land-use change**.
* Decision-making in land-use can be explained, to a large extent, by the **socio-economic, climatic and soil conditions of a location**, captured by global data proxies of these conditions.

### Decision-making case-studies, types and objectives

Characteristics of land-use decision-making types:

* The survivalist
* The subsistence-oriented smallholder
* Market-oriented smallholder
* Professional commercialist
* Professional intensifier
* Eco-agriculturalist

### contextual conditions

Explanatory variable used in contextual conditions: temperature, precipitation, aridity, altitude, slope, soil conditions, socio-economic conditions (population density, poverty, child malnutrition, GDP per capita, distance to roads, etc.)

### Statistical analysis

Three regression models used in three stages.
