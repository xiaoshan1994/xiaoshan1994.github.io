have a service carried out for you by someone else
* to have someone **do** something (have + person + infinitive + service) is
another way of saying to have something done
* to get someone to do something means the same as to have someone do
something, but note that to get requires the infinitive with to
* don’t confuse to have someone do something with to make someone do something. to make means to force / oblige. Thus, I made him clean the house means that I forced him to clean the house against probably against his will
