# Slavs
Slavs are the largest European ethnolinguistic group. Present-day Slavs are classified into **East Slavs** (chiefly Belarusians, Russians, Rusyns, and Ukrainians), **West Slavs** (chiefly Czechs, Kashubs, Poles, Slovaks, Silesians and Sorbs) and **South Slavs** (chiefly Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Serbs and Slovenes).

## Languages
The First Bulgarian Empire was founded in 681 as an alliance between the ruling Bulgars and the numerous slavs in the area, and their South Slavic language, the Old Church Slavonic, became the main and official language of the empire in 864. Bulgaria was instrumental in the spread of Slavic literacy and Christianity to the rest of the Slavic world.

Slavic linguistic unity was to some extent visible as late as Old Church Slavonic (or Old Bulgarian) manuscripts which, though based on local Slavic speech of Thessaloniki, could still serve the purpose of the first common Slavic literary language.

The alphabets used for Slavic languages are usually connected to the **dominant religion** among the respective ethnic groups. {{< hl-text blue>}}Orthodox Christians{{< /hl-text >}} use the {{< hl-text blue>}}Cyrillic alphabet{{< /hl-text >}} while {{< hl-text blue>}}Catholics{{< /hl-text >}} use the {{< hl-text blue>}}Latin alphabet{{< /hl-text >}}; the {{< hl-text blue>}}Bosniaks{{< /hl-text >}}, who are Muslim, also use the {{< hl-text blue>}}Latin alphabet{{< /hl-text >}}. Additionally, some Eastern Catholics and Western Catholics use the Cyrillic alphabet. Serbian and Montenegrin use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. There is also a Latin script to write in Belarusian, called Łacinka and in Ukrainian, called Latynka.

## Ethno-cultural subdivisions

West Slavs originate from {{< hl-text blue>}}early Slavic tribes{{< /hl-text >}} which settled in {{< hl-text blue>}}Central Europe{{< /hl-text >}} after the {{< hl-text blue>}}East Germanic tribes{{< /hl-text >}} had left this area during the migration period. They are noted as having mixed with Germanics, Hungarians, Celts (particularly the Boii), Old Prussians, and the Pannonian Avars. The West Slavs came under the influence of the Western Roman Empire (Latin) and of the Catholic Church.

East Slavs have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed and contacted with {{< hl-text blue>}}Finns{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}Balts{{< /hl-text >}}. Their early Slavic component, Antes, mixed or absorbed Iranians, and later received influence from the Khazars and Vikings. The East Slavs trace their national origins to the tribal unions of Kievan Rus' and Rus' Khaganate, beginning in the 10th century. They came particularly under the influence of the {{< hl-text blue>}}Byzantine Empire{{< /hl-text >}} and of the {{< hl-text blue>}}Eastern Orthodox Church{{< /hl-text >}}.

South Slavs from most of the region have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed with the local Proto-Balkanic tribes (Illyrian, Dacian, Thracian, Paeonian, Hellenic tribes), and Celtic tribes (particularly the Scordisci), as well as with Romans (and the Romanized remnants of the former groups), and also with remnants of temporarily settled invading East Germanic, Asiatic or Caucasian tribes such as Gepids, Huns, Avars, Goths and Bulgars. The original inhabitants of present-day Slovenia and continental Croatia have origins in early Slavic tribes who mixed with Romans and romanized Celtic and Illyrian people as well as with Avars and Germanic peoples (Lombards and East Goths). The South Slavs ({{< hl-text blue>}}except the Slovenes and Croats{{< /hl-text >}}) came under the cultural sphere of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), of the Ottoman Empire and of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Islam, while the {{< hl-text blue>}}Slovenes and the Croats{{< /hl-text >}} were influenced by the Western Roman Empire (Latin) and thus by the Catholic Church in a similar fashion to that of the West Slavs.

## Genetics
According to Y chromosome, mDNA, and autosomal marker CCR5de132, the gene pool of {{< hl-text blue>}}Eastern (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians) and Western Slavs (Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks){{< /hl-text >}} is identical, which is consistent with the proximity of their languages, demonstrating significant differences from neighboring Finno-Ugric, Turkic, and North Caucasian peoples. Such genetic homogeneity is somewhat unusual, given such a wide dispersal of Slavic populations, especially Russians. Together they form the basis of the "East European" gene cluster, which also includes non-Slavic Hungarians and Aromanians.

The 2006 Y-DNA study results "suggest that the Slavic expansion started from the territory of present-day {{< hl-text blue>}}Ukraine{{< /hl-text >}}, thus supporting the hypothesis that places the earliest known homeland of Slavs in the basin of the middle Dnieper". According to genetic studies until 2020, the distribution, variance and frequency of the Y-DNA haplogroups R1a and I2 and their subclades R-M558, R-M458 and I-CTS10228 among South Slavs are in correlation with the spreading of Slavic languages during the medieval Slavic expansion from Eastern Europe, most probably from the territory of present-day Ukraine and Southeastern Poland.

# Old Prussians and Prussia
Old Prussians, Baltic Prussians or simply Prussians were an {{< hl-text blue>}}indigenous tribe{{< /hl-text >}} among the Baltic peoples that inhabited the region of Prussia, at the {{< hl-text blue>}}south-eastern shore of the Baltic Sea{{< /hl-text >}}.

The duchy of the Polans under {{< hl-text blue>}}Mieszko I{{< /hl-text >}}[^mie], which was the predecessor of the Kingdom of Poland, first attempted to conquer and baptize the Baltic tribes during the 10th century, but repeatedly encountered strong resistance. Not until the 13th century were the Old Prussians subjugated and their lands conquered by the {{< hl-text blue>}}Teutonic Order{{< /hl-text >}}. The remaining Old Prussians were assimilated during the following two centuries. The old Prussian language, largely undocumented, was effectively extinct by the 17th century.

The original territory of the Old Prussians prior to the first clashes with the Polans consisted of central and southern West and East Prussia, equivalent to parts of the modern areas of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in {{< hl-text blue>}}Poland{{< /hl-text >}}, the Kaliningrad Oblast in {{< hl-text blue>}}Russia{{< /hl-text >}} and the southern Klaipėda Region in {{< hl-text blue>}}Lithuania{{< /hl-text >}}. The territory was also inhabited by Scalovians, a tribe related to the Prussians, Curonians and Eastern Balts.

Prussia was a historically prominent {{< hl-text blue>}}German state{{< /hl-text >}} that originated in {{< hl-text blue>}}1525{{< /hl-text >}} with a duchy centered on the region of Prussia on the southeast coast of the Baltic Sea. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in {{< hl-text blue>}}1932{{< /hl-text >}} and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947.

In 1871, owing to the efforts of Prussian Minister-President {{< hl-text blue>}}Otto von Bismarck{{< /hl-text >}}/ˈbɪzmɑːk, ˈɒtəʊ vɒn/, most German principalities were united into the German Empire under Prussian leadership.

The end of Prussia
The areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, mainly Eastern Prussia, Western Prussia, and Silesia, were ceded over to Poland and the Soviet Union in {{< hl-text blue>}}1945{{< /hl-text >}} owing to the {{< hl-text blue>}}Treaty of Potsdam{{< /hl-text >}}[^pos]between {{< hl-text blue>}}three of the Allies{{< /hl-text >}}: the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. This included important Prussian cities like Danzig, Königsberg, Breslau, and Stettin. The population fled, mostly to the Western zones, or was driven out.

[^mie]: Mieszko I  (c. 930 – 25 May 992) was the ruler of Poland from about 960 to his death and was the founder of the first independent Polish state, the Duchy of Poland.
[^pos]: The Potsdam Agreement was the August 1945 agreement between three of the Allies of World War II: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. A product of the Potsdam Conference, it concerned the military occupation and reconstruction of Germany, its borders, and the entire European Theatre of War territory. It also addressed Germany's demilitarisation, reparations, the prosecution of war criminals and the mass expulsion of ethnic Germans from various parts of Europe.
