Schopenhauer, a disciple of Kant, takes over and transforms Kantian idealism. Reading it requires some knowledge of Kantian philosophy.

The World as Will and Representation
作为意志和表象的世界

The epistemology of Schopenhauer:
Schopenhauer posits from the outset that the world is an idea insofar as it is an object in the mind of a subject. The subject / object relation is that of all or nothing: if an object is perceived, it is then in the subject and thus becomes idea.

According to Schopenhauer, all objects of perception respect the fourfold principle of sufficient reason: physical form, mathematical form, logical form, and moral form.

The philosophical career of Jean Paul Sartre (1905-1980) focuses, in its first phase, upon the construction of a philosophy of existence known as {{< hl-text blue>}}existentialism{{< /hl-text >}}.

Sartre’s ontology is explained in his philosophical masterpiece, Being and Nothingness, where he defines two types of reality which lie beyond our conscious experience: the being of the object of consciousness and that of consciousness itself. The object of consciousness exists as “in-itself,” that is, in an independent and non-relational way. However, consciousness is always consciousness “of something,” so it is defined in relation to something else, and it is not possible to grasp it within a conscious experience: it exists as “for-itself.” An essential feature of consciousness is its negative power, by which we can experience “nothingness.” This power is also at work within the self, where it creates an intrinsic lack of self-identity. So the unity of the self is understood as a task for the for-itself rather than as a given.

In order to ground itself, the self needs projects, which can be viewed as aspects of an individual’s fundamental project and motivated by a desire for “being” lying within the individual’s consciousness. The source of this project is a spontaneous original choice that depends on the individual’s freedom. However, self’s choice may lead to a project of self-deception such as bad faith, where one’s own real nature as for-itself is discarded to adopt that of the in-itself. Our only way to escape self-deception is authenticity, that is, choosing in a way which reveals the existence of the for-itself as both factual and transcendent. For Sartre, my proper exercise of freedom creates values that any other human being placed in my situation could experience, therefore each authentic project expresses a universal dimension in the singularity of a human life.
