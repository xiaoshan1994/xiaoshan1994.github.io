Schopenhauer, a disciple of Kant, takes over and transforms Kantian idealism. Reading it requires some knowledge of Kantian philosophy.

The World as Will and Representation
作为意志和表象的世界

The epistemology of Schopenhauer:
Schopenhauer posits from the outset that the world is an idea insofar as it is an object in the mind of a subject. The subject / object relation is that of all or nothing: if an object is perceived, it is then in the subject and thus becomes idea.

According to Schopenhauer, all objects of perception respect the fourfold principle of sufficient reason: physical form, mathematical form, logical form, and moral form.
