# EVERYTHING IS MADE OF WATER THALES OF MILETUS (C.624–546 BCE)
/ˈθeili:z/ n. 泰利斯（希腊哲学家）

Thales reasons that the fundamental material of the universe had to be
something out of which everything else could be formed, as well as being essential to life, and capable of motion and therefore of change.

He observes that water is clearly necessary to sustain all forms of life, and that it moves and changes, assuming different forms – from liquid to solid ice and vaporous mist. So Thales concludes that all matter, regardless of its apparent properties, must be water in some stage of transformation.

# THE DAO THAT CAN BE TOLD IS NOT THE ETERNAL DAO LAOZI (C.6TH CENTURY BCE)

The changes are cyclical, continually moving from one state to another, such as from night to day, summer to winter, and so on. They saw the different states not as opposites, but as related, one arising from the other. These states also possess complementary properties that together make up a whole. The process of change is seen as an expression of dao. But because of our desire and free will, we can stray from the dao, and disturb the world’s harmonious balance. To live a virtuous life means acting in accordance with the dao.

We can only live according to the dao by wu wei, literally “non-action.” By this Laozi does not mean “not doing”, but acting in accordance with
nature—spontaneously and intuitively. That in turn entails acting without desire, ambition, or recourse to social conventions.

# Number is the ruler of forms and ideas Pythagoras C.570 - 495 BCE
