(Outward processing from EU commission)[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures-import-and-export/what-exportation/outward-processing_en]
Outward processing means that Union goods may be {{< hl-text blue>}}temporarily exported{{< /hl-text >}} from the customs territory of the Union in order to {{< hl-text blue>}}undergo processing operations{{< /hl-text >}}. The processed products resulting from these goods can be re-imported and released for free circulation with total or partial relief from import duty. A total relief from import duties must be granted when the goods have been exported merely to be repaired free of charge because of a contractual obligation or because of a manufacturing or material defect. In other cases of outward processing, the import duties on the re-imported products are calculated only on the basis of the value resulting from the processing operation undertaken outside the customs territory of the Union.

Outward processing procedure is designed to give businesses the possibility to take advantage of benefits such as lower labour costs or specific technical expertise in non-EU countries.

(Inward processing from EU commission)[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures-import-and-export/what-importation/inward-processing_en]

Inward processing means that {{< hl-text blue>}}non-Union goods{{< /hl-text >}} are imported in order to be used in the customs territory of the Union in {{< hl-text blue>}}one or more processing operations{{< /hl-text >}}, for instance, for the purposes of {{< hl-text blue>}}manufacturing or repair{{< /hl-text >}}. When imported, such goods are not subject to: Import duty, other taxes related to their import, such as VAT and/or excises, and commercial policy measures.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Inward processing procedure is designed to give businesses the possibility to process goods imported from outside the customs territory of the Union even before they decide, according to logistical, commercial or other conditions, whether to sell the finished products within the Union or outside.{{< /hl-text >}} The inward processing procedure can also be used for goods which just have to undergo standard forms of handling intended to preserve them, improve their appearance or marketable quality or prepare them for distribution or resale.

After the processing operations, the processed products can be either re-exported or released for free circulation in the EU; the latter would imply the obligation to pay import duty and taxes, as well as the application of commercial policy measures. In addition, it is also possible to store processed products under customs warehousing or in a free zone.
