MUTTON
[instrumental music playing]
[narrator] Gansu. Spanning morethan 1,600 kilometers from east to west.
It's the same distancefrom Milan to Istanbul.
With different types of terrainsand a variety of lamb breeds,
people in Gansu know how to modifytheir ways to suit their environment
and make the mutton taste delicious.
The meat of an eight-month-old lambis very tender
and needs to be marinatedand cooked carefully.
Stir-frying and braising themare the best ways.
BRAISED MUTTON
Dongxiang lamb has the perfect fatto lean meat ratio.
Just boil them,and they will be delicious.
Lamb over two years old shouldbe boiled longer in order to taste better.
MUTTON NOODLE SOUP
JIAYUGUAN, GANSU
At 8 a.m.,Huang Zhitao starts making suet.
In Jiayuguan, this is the basecooking ingredient in every household.
Extract fat from the lamb's body,and cook them slowly in low heat.
Then add spicesto remove the mutton's gamey smell.
At a temperature lowerthan 40 degrees Celsius,
the oil begins to solidifyand waits for its flavor to be unleashed.
Jiayuguan, where the main trafficof the ancient Silk Road was,
is now a progressive cityin northwestern Gansu.
The people here are especially fondof a particular kind of mutton delicacy.
-[man] Regular barbecued?-Okay, coming right up.
[narrator] A seemingly ordinarybarbecued lamb
needs to be handled using a unique method.
Exquisite and moist, like white jade,
this is the suetthat was rendered eight hours ago.
As the suet is heated,it emits a complex fragrance.
The lamb skewers are pre-barbecuedfor a short time
in a special metal canand swiftly dipped in oil.
The rich fats quickly lock in the juices,
and also bring more flavorinto the mutton.
With the suet's surface tensionthe seasoning can be evenly spread.
Afterwards, barbecue the meat skewers
until the surface becomes burntand crispy.
With the suet as a buffer,the lamb remains tender and juicy.
JIAYUGUAN GRILLED LAMB
-[man] Which room?-Xiongguan 12 Pillars. Serve it.
All right. Marrow, kidneys done.
All right, continue with the tripe. Go.
[narrator] The entire lamb is cutinto  20 different parts.
In the hands of people in Jiayuguan,every part can have different flavors.
The bone marrow's texture is very tender.
After grilling,it becomes as delicate as butter.
Lamb tripe, covered in suet and barbecued.
The oil sizzles; its texture is chewy.
The lambskin is crystal clear.
Its gummy texture is slowly contracting in the fire.
The lean meat is slowly barbecuedat low heat. Fragrant and chewy.
Lamb chops are still the most enticing,where its fat and meat ratio are equal.
Take a chunk of fat off the meat.
It's very enjoyable.
Jiayuguan is a city of migrants.
With different regional backgrounds,
their different preferencesreach an agreement
in a stick of lamb skewer.
[man singing softly]
800 km southeast,on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
is the residence of Gannan Tibetans.
JIAYUGUAN
August.
There is plenty of waterand greenery here.
This is the summer pastureof the Cairang family.
GANJIA GRASSLAND IS AROUND 3,000 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
CAIRANG JIA
FA LAU, WIFE
The lives of herders revolve around lambs.
They migrate to areaswith different sea levels
depending on the season.
Mutton is their main source of meat.
The cold weatherslows the growth of Ganjia lambs,
leaving to abundant flavor.
[sheep baaing]
-[whipping]-[men shouting]
[sheep baaing]
Fresh mutton has an enticing pink color.
Its fibers are thin.
The meat is tender.
Due to the low contentof short-chain fatty acids,
it almost doesn't have a gamey smell.
It just needs to be marinatedwith a little salt.
However, at almost 4,000 metersabove sea level,
the water's boiling pointis below 80 degrees Celsius.
It's hard to finish cooking itin a normal way.
Clean the lamb tripe.
It will be put to great use.
Place the meat into the lamb tripe.
Scallions and chili add more flavor.
The real cooking is about to begin.
Grill the cobblestones.They slowly absorb the heat.
After one hour, the temperaturewill be over 200 degrees Celsius.
Place the hot cobblestonesinto the lamb tripe.
It will emit a huge amount of energy.
While being grilled on a high heat,the mutton slowly releases juices.
[indistinct chatter]
Add the cobblestones periodically,
and the heat accumulates.
The lamb tripe is airtight.
The pressure inside keeps buildinglike a natural pressure cooker.
A portion of the juices turns into gas.
Grilling, steaming, and boilinghappens at the same time.
The mutton is covered in its juices.
Burnt and brown on the outside,it's cooking very quickly.
Only 15 minutes, and it's done.
At this time,the mutton is soft and tender.
It also has a unique barbecued aroma.
Rich and flavorful.
Cooking using stones is calleddaoshihe in the Tibetan language.
This method satisfies the cooking tooland heat source requirement of herders.
Quick and convenient,
it maximizes the original flavorof mutton.
A unique delicacy is producedout of local conditions.
