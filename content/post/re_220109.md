# The Average Propagation Length: Conflicting Macro, Intra-industry, and Interindustry Conclusions

Hence, our conclusion, on both counts, is that it is wrong to interpret the macro APL(average propagation length, measuring number of rounds of sector A's impact before reaching sector B) as an indication of the sophistication of the economy at hand or of the spatial fragmentation of its production chains, because its value follows from a simple sequence: {{< hl-text orange>}}the larger the economy, the larger its aggregate multiplier (i.e., l = g), the more rounds K are needed before its Taylor expansion converges, and thus the large its propagation length v.{{< /hl-text >}} This makes the APL unsuited for comparing domestic supply chains across nations and regions.

Restricting the comparison of APLs of {{< hl-text blue>}}pure interindustry linkages{{< /hl-text >}} to the stronger ones makes sense, also across nations and regions, but doing that for {{< hl-text blue>}}intra-industry linkages{{< /hl-text >}} or for the macro APL is senseless.
