# Begin with some companies

## Thomson Reuters

Thomson Reuters Corporation is {{< hl-text blue>}}Canada-based multinational media corporation{{< /hl-text >}}. The company was founded in {{< hl-text blue>}}Toronto, Ontario, Canada,{{< /hl-text >}} where it is headquartered at the Bay Adelaide Centre.

Thomson Reuters was created by the {{< hl-text blue>}}Thomson Corporation{{< /hl-text >}}'s purchase of the {{< hl-text blue>}}British company{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text blue>}}Reuters Group{{< /hl-text >}} in April 2008.

## Clarivate

Clarivate is a company formed in 2016, following the acquisition of Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property and Science Business by Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia.

Clarivate (formerly **Clarivate Analytics**) was formerly the Intellectual Property and Science **division** of **Thomson Reuters**. Before 2008, it was known as Thomson Scientific. In **2016**, Thomson Reuters struck a $3.55 billion deal in which they spun it off into an independent company, and sold it to **private-equity firms** Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia.

Clarivate owns and operates a collection of subscription-based services focused largely on analytics. The services include {{< hl-text blue>}}Web of Science{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}EndNote{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}InCites/JCR{{< /hl-text >}}, etc.

### Web of Science

Web of Science and Scopus are the largest worldwide-used **{{< hl-text blue>}}citation databases{{< /hl-text >}}**[^cita]. Today, these are the most respected platforms for analysing peer-reviewed literature: scientific publications, conference proceedings, and books.

{{< alert info >}} Scopus is Elsevier's abstract and citation database launched in 2004. {{< /alert >}}

**The Web of Science Core Collection** consists of **six** online databases:

***Science Citation Index Expanded*** (SCIE) covers more than **8,500** notable journals encompassing 150 disciplines. Coverage is from the year 1900 to the present day.
***Social Sciences Citation Index*** (SSCI) covers more than **3,000** journals in social science disciplines. Range of coverage is from the year 1900 to the present day.
***Arts & Humanities Citation Index*** covers more than **1,700** arts and humanities journals starting from 1975. In addition, 250 major scientific and social sciences journals are also covered.
***Emerging Sources Citation Index*** covers over **5,000** journals in the sciences, social science, and humanities.
***Book Citation Index*** covers more than **60,000** editorially selected books starting from 2005.
***Conference Proceedings Citation Index*** (CPCI) covers more than **160,000** conference titles in the Sciences starting from 1990 to the present day.

## Journal Citation Reports

Clarivate publishes the annual Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which identifies the world's most impactful academic journals included in the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index, part of the Web of Science Core Collection.

### Journal Impact Factor

An offshoot of citation analysis is **Journal Impact Factor (JIF)** which is used to sort or rank journals by their relative importance. The underlying assumption behind Impact Factors (IF) is that journals with high IF publish articles that are cited more often than journals with lower IF.

Impact factors may be used by:

* Authors to decide where to submit an article for publication.
* Libraries to make collection development decisions
* Academic departments to assess academic productivity
* Academic departments to make decisions on promotion and tenure.

How is the Journal Impact Factor Calculated?

Thomson defines impact factor as, **{{< hl-text orange>}}“The journal Impact Factor is the average number of times articles from the journal published in the past two years have been cited in the JCR year.{{< /hl-text >}}** ***{{< hl-text green>}}The Impact Factor is calculated by dividing the number of citations in the JCR year by the total number of articles published in the two previous years.{{< /hl-text >}}*** An Impact Factor of 2.5 means that, on average, the articles published one or two year ago have been cited two and a half times. Citing articles may be from the same journal; most citing articles are from different journals.”

JIF without self citations is calculated by subtracting self citations in the last two years.

Factors to Consider While Consulting Impact Factors

**Publication Date**: The impact factor is based on citation frequency of articles from a journal in their first few years of publication. This does not serve well the journals with articles that get cited over a longer period of time (let's say, 10 years) rather than immediately. In other words, ***journals in rapidly expanding fields such as cell biology and computing tend to have much higher immediate citation rates leading to higher IFs than journals in fields like Education or Economics.***

**Journal Impact Factor not Article Impact Factor**: Citations to articles in a journal are not evenly distributed. ***In fact, some articles in a journal may not be cited at all but a few highly cited articles could lead to a high IF.*** Therefore, the IF does not accurately reflect the quality of individual articles published in a journal. Also, journals with more issues and articles can have higher Impact Factors which could be misleading as it does not really reflect the quality of articles.

**Review Articles**: ***Review articles (which tend to receive more citations), editorials, letters, and news items are not counted in article total but if cited are counted as citations for the journal.*** This leaves room for manipulation of ratio used to calculate impact factors leading to inflated impact factors in some cases.

**Clinical Journals**: Clinical journals usually have low citation counts. This puts such journals at a disadvantage with research journals in the field that have higher citation counts.

**Uneven Coverage**: The Journal Citation Reports focuses much more on disciplines where the primary means of publishing is through journal article. It provides less coverage to areas in Social Sciences and Humanities, where books and other publishing formats are more prevalent.

## Journal Citation Indicator (JCI)
{{< hl-text orange>}}The average JCI in a category is 1. Journals with a JCI of 1.5 have 50% more citation impact than the average in that category.{{< /hl-text >}}

## Cited Half-life
{{< hl-text orange>}}The Cited Half-Life is the median age of the citations received by a journal during the JCR year.{{< /hl-text >}} For example, a 2015 Cited Half-Life value of 7.0 for Journal X means that half of the Journal X papers that were cited in 2015 were published in the last 7 years.

## 5 Year Impact Factor

The 5-year Impact Factor is the average number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year. {{< hl-text orange>}}It is calculated by dividing the number of citations in the JCR year by the total number of articles published in the five previous years.{{< /hl-text >}}


## Major difference between CiteScore and Journal Impact Factor

* CiteScore calculation is based on **Scopus data**, while Impact Factor is based on Web of Science data.
* CiteScore uses a **4-year window** while Impact Factor adopts a **2-year window**.
* CiteScore includes more document types indexed by Scopus, including articles, reviews, conference papers, data papers and book chapters; while Impact Factor only includes **"citable documents"** which are articles and reviews.

# Google Scholar Metrics

## h-index
The number of papers (h) with a citation number ≥ h. Example: a scientist with an H-Index of 37 has 37 papers cited at least 37 times.

## i10-Index
The number of publications with at least 10 citations.  

Finally, the h5-index, h5-core, and h5-median of a publication are, respectively, the h-index, h-core, and h-median of only those of its articles that were published in the last five complete calendar years.

## ScienceDirect

{{< hl-text orange>}}ScienceDirect is a {{< /hl-text >}}{{< hl-text orange>}}**website**{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}which provides access to a large {{< /hl-text >}}**{{< hl-text orange>}}full-text database{{< /hl-text >}}** {{< hl-text orange>}}of scientific and medical publications of the{{< /hl-text >}} **{{< hl-text orange>}}Dutch publisher Elsevier{{< /hl-text >}}**. The access to the full-text requires subscription, while the **bibliographic metadata** is free to read. {{< hl-text orange>}}ScienceDirect is operated by the British-Dutch publisher {{< /hl-text >}}**{{< hl-text orange>}}Elsevier{{< /hl-text >}}**. It was launched in March 1997.

[^cita]: Citation databases are databases that have been developed for evaluating publications. The citation databases enable you to **count citations** and check, for example, which articles or journals are the most cited ones. Note: None of the citation databases cover all publications. ***The coverage of different disciplines also varies greatly***. Citation analysis and bibliometric indicators are based on citations and the amount of them. Citing in itself, however, is not a quality criterion and there can be many reasons for the citing (**negative citations**, **ethnocentricity** (/ˌeθnəʊˈsentrɪk/), **self-citation**).
