This low P value / high R2 combination indicates that changes in the predictors are related to changes in the response variable and that your model explains a lot of the response variability."

In regression analysis, you'd like your regression model to have **significant variables** and to produce a high R-squared value. {{< hl-text orange >}}This low P value and high $R^2$ combination indicates that changes in the predictors are related to changes in the response variable and that your model explains a lot of the response variability.{{< /hl-text >}}

This combination seems to go together naturally. But what if your regression model has ***significant variables but explains little of the variability***? It has **low P values and a low R-squared**.

At first glance, this combination doesn’t make sense. Are the significant predictors still meaningful? Let’s look into this!

### Comparing regression models with low and high R-squared values

It’s difficult to understand this situation using numbers alone. Research shows that graphs are essential to correctly interpret regression analysis results. Comprehension is easier when you can see what is happening!

With this in mind, I'll use **fitted line plots**. However, a 2D fitted line plot can only display the results from simple regression, which has one predictor variable and the response. The concepts hold true for multiple linear regression, but I can’t graph the higher dimensions that are required.

These fitted line plots display two regression models that have nearly identical regression equations, but the top model has a low R-squared value while the other one is high. I’ve kept the graph scales constant for easier comparison. Here are the data for these examples.
