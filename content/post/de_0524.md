Get is a very common verb in English, but it is not always appropriate for talking about changes. Note
also alternatives to get which can improve your style.

## A *Go*, not *get*
Go is used for changes in people’s personality, appearance and physical abilities:
> People go mad/bald/grey/blind/deaf*.

Go is often used for sudden, usually negative, changes:

> He was very embarrassed and his face **went red**.

Go can also be used for slower colour changes:

> The pages of the book **had gone** yellow over the years.

## B *Turn*, not *get*
Turn often collocates with colours:

> The sky **turned gold** as the sun set.

> The news gave his mother such a shock that her hair **turned white** overnight.*

## C Get and become
Get and become can often be used with the same collocations, but become is more formal and is therefore more appropriate in essays:

> She gave up smoking when she became pregnant.

> I would like to become involved in raising money for charity.

The same is true for collocations with adjectives such as angry, bored, excited, depressed, upset, impatient, violent:

> He became depressed after his wife’s death.

## Alternatives to get and become

> She **fell ill** and was taken to hospital.

> Everyone **fell silent** when they heard the shocking news.

> As my father **grew older**, he spent less time working.

> The noise **grew louder** and soon we realised it was a plane approaching.
