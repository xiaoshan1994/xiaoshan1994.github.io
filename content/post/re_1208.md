**27/02/2020**
The Plastic Leak Project (launched in **2019**), led by ***Quantis*** and ***EA*** in partnership with ***35 public, private and scientific organizations***, has released a methodology to conduct plastic leakage assessments.

# Press Release (02/27/2020)
* About ***Quantis***: A sustainability consulting group.
* About ***EA***: EA is an ecodesign centre based in Switzerland (www.shaping-ea.com), member of the European Network of Ecodesign Centres (ENEC). Founded by **Julien Boucher**, also co-founder of Quantis, EA has developed a unique expertise in the field of marine plastic pollution and plastic footprinting.
* For the **first time**, businesses have a standardized, science-driven way to map, measure and forecast plastic (including microplastic) leakage across their value chains.
* These guidelines empower companies to translate their commitments to tackle plastic pollution into meaningful, metrics-based strategies and actions to reduce plastic leakage and mitigate business risks.
* A powerful methodology for driving meaningful action.

# Methodological Guidelines (05/2020, V1.3)
* Plastics enter the environment by one of two core streams: visible macroplastics mainly from mismanaged waste, and mostly invisible primary microplastics released from various sources, such as synthetic clothing during washing.
* Exposure to an aquatic environment not only degrades macroplastics into
{{< hl-text blue>}}secondary microplastics{{< /hl-text >}}, but also fragments primary microplastics into even smaller particles through {{< hl-text blue>}}photodegradation{{< /hl-text >}} and other {{< hl-text blue>}}weathering processes{{< /hl-text >}}.
* An overview of plastic leakage: 1. {{< hl-text blue>}}Coastal mismanaged (macro) plastic waste (MPW){{< /hl-text >}}: 8 Mt/year (people living within 50 km of shore across 192 countries). 2. {{< hl-text blue>}}Inland mismanaged (macro) plastic waste{{< /hl-text >}}: 1 Mt/year. 3. {{< hl-text blue>}}Microplastics{{< /hl-text >}}: 1.5 Mt/year of plastic enters the marine environment in the form of primary microplastics ({{< hl-text blue>}}abrasion of synthetic textiles{{< /hl-text >}} during washing (35%) and the {{< hl-text blue>}}erosion of tires{{< /hl-text >}} while driving (28%)).

## 3.1 What is leakage and how can it be modelled?
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Leakage is a result of both {{< hl-text blue>}}loss{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}release{{< /hl-text >}} through a {{< hl-text blue>}}transfer{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}redistribution{{< /hl-text >}} pathway.{{< /hl-text >}}
