1. The impact of Covid-19
* The surge in medical waste:  face masks and plastic gloves
* The boom in online shopping and food-takeaway: packaging
* The set-back on the bans on single-use plastics
2. System dynamics

1. The composition of increasing plastic demand during the covid-19
[](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364032120301763-gr3_lrg.jpg)
The plastic demand in the medical sector to help in combating the COVID-19 including the face shield (PP), gown (LDPE), vinyl gloves (PVC), disposable bag, tube, masks (plastic sheet and non-woven fabric) etc. (from WHO)

> Changes on the waste amount and composition trigger a structure change in **waste management system**

The relationship between MSW and plastics waste: treatment capacity change, waste change(decreased solid waste, increased packaging from deliveries and hospital)
> The amount of waste threatens to overwhelm existing treatment and disposal facilities, posing the risk of secondary contagion from improper waste management.

2. Scenarios for the future
* Disaster waste management: treatment approaches, infrastructure, capacity (scalability), mobilised/automated (e.g. remote-controlled robots) treatment and collection design, logistics, safety, and regulatory aspects link to the bio disaster response.
* Incorporation of social factors and uncertainties
* Better trade-offs between medical/healthcare plastics and regular single-use plastics
