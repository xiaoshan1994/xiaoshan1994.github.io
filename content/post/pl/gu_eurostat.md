Recycling of biowaste


Recovery rate of construction and demolition waste

Definition
Major mineral waste: Major mineral waste are excluded because weight of total waste generation and treatment is mainly driven by mineral waste from construction/demolition and from mining activities, and the latter widely varies in importance across Member States. Excluding major mineral wastes reflects more accurately general trends than the total waste and improves comparability across countries.
