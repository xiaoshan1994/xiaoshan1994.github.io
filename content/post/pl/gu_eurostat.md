# Explanatory texts
## Statistics explained - [Waste statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics#Total_waste_generation)
Waste, defined by Directive 2008/98/EC Article 3(1) as {{< hl-text blue>}}‘any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard‘{{< /hl-text >}}.

The share of different economic activities and of households in total waste generation in 2018 is presented in Figure 1. In the EU, {{< hl-text blue>}}construction{{< /hl-text >}} contributed 35.9 % of the total in 2018 and was followed by {{< hl-text blue>}}mining and quarrying{{< /hl-text >}} (26.6 %), {{< hl-text blue>}}manufacturing{{< /hl-text >}} (10.6 %), {{< hl-text blue>}}waste and water services{{< /hl-text >}} (9.8 %) and {{< hl-text blue>}}households{{< /hl-text >}} (8.2 %); the remaining 9.1 % was waste generated from other economic activities, mainly services (4.2 %) and energy (3.4 %).

## Major mineral waste
Major mineral waste are excluded because weight of total waste generation and treatment is mainly driven by mineral waste from construction/demolition and from mining activities, and the latter widely varies in importance across Member States. Excluding major mineral wastes reflects more accurately general trends than the total waste and improves comparability across countries.

## Generation of municipal waste per capita
The indicator measures the waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities and disposed of through the waste management system. It consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, though similar wastes from sources such as commerce, offices and public institutions may be included.

Interpretation of the indicator
Reducing municipal waste generation is an indication of {{< hl-text blue>}}the effectiveness of waste prevention measures {{< /hl-text >}}and {{< hl-text blue>}}changing patterns of consumption on the part of the citizens{{< /hl-text >}}. Concentrating on municipal waste rather than on industrial waste has the advantage that it reflects the consumption side and is not affected by the presence or lack of strong manufacturing sectors in a country.

This indicator focuses on municipal waste. Even though municipal waste only represents about {{< hl-text blue>}}10%{{< /hl-text >}}of the total waste generated or about {{< hl-text blue>}}30%{{< /hl-text >}} of the generated amount of waste excluding major mineral waste, following up on its evolution can give a good indication of changing consumption patterns and of Member States' waste prevention performance and where citizens' actions and involvement is most relevant.
