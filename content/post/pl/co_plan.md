1. recycling capacity
the recycling capacity doesn't match the production and import of waste
2. why countries accepting waste are those countries having a higher mismanagement rate?
3. The plastic waste trade has severe negative impacts which can be classified into three categories: environmental, social/health and economic.

Environmental impacts:
* land and water quality degradation
the leakage of toxic chemicals from informal dumps and landfills.
* Air pollution
open burning and incineration. Small particulate matter.
* loss of biodiversity and ecological health
ingestion and entanglement to chemical contamination and affect threatened, endangered species.
* Climate change
open burning and incineration.

Economic impacts:
* Cost to the global economy
* Clean-up costs
* Loss of livelihoods
* Corruption, tax fraud and money laundering
* Displacement of domestic recycling efforts

how is plastic waste exported?
Step 1: waste generation
municipal/household waste; industrial, business and commercial waste
Step 2: Collection
Step 3: Sorting in source country
Waste collected for reprocessing is sent to a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) to be sorted.
A PRF(plastic recovery facility) is an additional degree of sorting, occurring either within an MRF or within a separate PRF facility. This step separates plastic by polymer type (i.e. HDPE, PET) and as a result, increases its purity and market value.
