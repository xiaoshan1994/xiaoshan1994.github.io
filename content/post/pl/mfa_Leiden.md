# Abstract

* How can the plastic mass balance of an urban area be modelled using Material Flow Analysis?
* Developing a generic framework, which includes eight consumption sectors, three distinguishable littering processes and two subsystems (surface water system and soil)
* A bottom-up approach is applied and the municipality of Leiden in the Netherlands is used as a case study.
* The biggest plastic flows are packaging flows (4146 t), plastics in building waste (1342 t) and plastics in End-of-life transportation systems (570 t). The highest plastic stocks are in buildings (86080 t), transportation (14020 t) and electronics devices (10326 t).

# 2 Theory

## 2.1 Material Flow Analysis

### 2.1.1 Material Flow Analysis Studies on Plastic Flows
* Only little research tried to assess plastic flows on the regional level.
* Many analysis lacks stock assessment.
* Joosten et al. (2000) assessed the plastic flows in the Netherlands using a so called STREAM method: the supply and the use analysis & the final consumption analysis. The method translates national “{{< hl-text blue>}}supply and use tables{{< /hl-text >}}” from monetary units into physical units in order to account for the plastic flows on a national level.

## 2.2 Citizen Science
* Mobile application [**Litterati**](https://litterati.org/): focusing on land-based litter in the natural and urban environment with geo- and time- tagged plastic pieces (also tags for describing).
* Currently there are around 3082 data entries for the year of 2019 (May 2020) on Litterati for the city of Leiden.

# 3 Case Study Description
## 3.1 Municipality Leiden
### 3.1.1 Subsystem Surface Water
* The municipal surface water system of Leiden is enclosed by **three big water bodies**, the Kagerplassen in the North, the Vlietland in the South and the Valkenburgse Meer in the West.
* The Polder water system is lower than the Boezem water system, surrounding most of the BWS.

## 4.2 Investigated Materials
## 4.4 Packaging
* Not considered as a stock because of a short lifetime.
* Inflow data is from Afvalfonds Verpakkingen (2019) for the year 2018, which is allocated to Leiden according to citizen population ratio.
* Assuming same compositions of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in the research of Brouwer et al. (2018).
* Assuming same plastic material types analysed as in Cornelissen and Otte (1995)'s research.
## 4.5 Buildings
