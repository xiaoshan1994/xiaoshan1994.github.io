# Open Dumping
[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/illegal-dumping/Pages/open-dumping.aspx)
 An open dump is an {{< hl-text blue>}}illegal waste disposal site{{< /hl-text >}} and should not be confused with a permitted municipal solid waste landfill or a recycling facility
![](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/illegal-dumping/PublishingImages/open-dump.jpg)
Any of the following seven conditions at a dump site can result in the issuance of an Administrative Citation:
* Litter
* Scavenging
* Open burning
* Placement of waste in standing or flowing water
* Promoting an increase of disease-carrying organisms
* Standing or flowing liquid discharge from the dump site
* Deposition of construction or demolition debris

> Open dumps, unlike sanitary landfills, are not engineered to protect the environment and human health...these sites are important sources of economic survival for expert recyclers – the world’s waste pickers – who earn a daily living there and feed our waste into the global recycling chain.

* Open dumps are the most prevalent form of waste disposal in the Global South.

# Inventory parameters for regionalised mixes of municipal waste disposal in ecoinvent v3.5
Technical report Zurich, **December 2018**

Employed disposal activities in the model encompass a selection of {{< hl-text blue>}}unmanaged activities (open burning, open dumping){{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}activities managed to different degrees (unsanitary landfill, sanitary landfill, municipal incineration){{< /hl-text >}}.

we decided to create {{< hl-text blue>}}five different climate classes{{< /hl-text >}} based on {{< hl-text blue>}}annual water infiltration{{< /hl-text >}} to discern the different local conditions, instead of inventorying the activities of each country with their specific climate.

From the present project, ecoinvent inventories for market mixes for {{< hl-text blue>}}37 European countries{{< /hl-text >}} are created, plus {{< hl-text blue>}}five focus countries of the Sustainable Recycling Initiative SRI{{< /hl-text >}} (Brazil, Colombia, Peru, India, South Africa).

{{< hl-text orange>}}Swiss disposal technologies in 1992{{< /hl-text >}}:
* municipal incineration with elaborate flue gas cleaning
* well-engineered sanitary landfills with landfill gas capture and leachate treatment
* well buffered residual material landfills for polluted inorganic waste

## Municipal waste disposal technology mix
* Open dump (unmanaged)
* Open burning (unmanaged)
* Unsanitary landfill (minimal management)
* Sanitary landfill (managed plant)
* Municipal incineration (managed plant)
