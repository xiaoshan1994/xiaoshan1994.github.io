# Open Dumping
[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/illegal-dumping/Pages/open-dumping.aspx)
 An open dump is an {{< hl-text blue>}}illegal waste disposal site{{< /hl-text >}} and should not be confused with a permitted municipal solid waste landfill or a recycling facility
![](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/illegal-dumping/PublishingImages/open-dump.jpg)
Any of the following seven conditions at a dump site can result in the issuance of an Administrative Citation:
* Litter
* Scavenging
* Open burning
* Placement of waste in standing or flowing water
* Promoting an increase of disease-carrying organisms
* Standing or flowing liquid discharge from the dump site
* Deposition of construction or demolition debris

> Open dumps, unlike sanitary landfills, are not engineered to protect the environment and human health...these sites are important sources of economic survival for expert recyclers – the world’s waste pickers – who earn a daily living there and feed our waste into the global recycling chain.

* Open dumps are the most prevalent form of waste disposal in the Global South.

# Inventory parameters for regionalised mixes of municipal waste disposal in ecoinvent v3.5

Employed disposal activities in the model encompass a selection of {{< hl-text blue>}}unmanaged activities (open burning, open dumping){{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}activities managed to different degrees (unsanitary landfill, sanitary landfill, municipal incineration){{< /hl-text >}}.

we decided to create {{< hl-text blue>}}five different climate classes{{< /hl-text >}} based on {{< hl-text blue>}}annual water infiltration{{< /hl-text >}} to discern the different local conditions, instead of inventorying the activities of each country with their specific climate.

From the present project, ecoinvent inventories for market mixes for {{< hl-text blue>}}37 European countries{{< /hl-text >}} are created, plus {{< hl-text blue>}}five focus countries of the Sustainable Recycling Initiative SRI{{< /hl-text >}} (Brazil, Colombia, Peru, India, South Africa).

{{< hl-text orange>}}Swiss disposal technologies in 1992{{< /hl-text >}}:
* municipal incineration with elaborate flue gas cleaning
* well-engineered sanitary landfills with landfill gas capture[^LFG] and leachate treatment
* well buffered residual material landfills for polluted inorganic waste

## Municipal waste disposal technology mix
1. Open dump (unmanaged)
  {{< hl-text blue>}}Uncollected waste{{< /hl-text >}} or collected waste with unmanaged disposals.
2. Open burning (unmanaged)
  Uncollected waste or collected waste with unmanaged disposals.
3. Unsanitary landfill (minimal management)
    Waste is {{< hl-text blue>}}compacted{{< /hl-text >}} and a {{< hl-text blue>}}daily cover{{< /hl-text >}} is applied. This mitigates the direct unhygienic effects of dumps, but {{< hl-text blue>}}emissions to air or water{{< /hl-text >}} remain unmitigated.   
4. Sanitary landfill (managed plant)
  sanitary landfills {{< hl-text blue>}}capture some landfill gas and treat the leachate{{< /hl-text >}}. In LCA results the {{< hl-text blue>}}flaring or utilization of landfill gas{{< /hl-text >}} is the most relevant difference compared to unsanitary landfills. Where information is available on landfill gas utilisation, it can be incorporated into the technology mix.
5. Municipal incineration (managed plant)
  Municipal incineration plants are {{< hl-text blue>}}costly investments{{< /hl-text >}} and are currently only observed in countries with a {{< hl-text blue>}}Gross National Income (GNI) above 10'000 $/capita.yr{{< /hl-text >}}. In countries below that threshold incineration can very likely be excluded.
[^LFG]: [Landfill gas (LFG)](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas#:~:text=LFG%20is%20extracted%20from%20landfills,in%20an%20LFG%20energy%20project.) is a natural byproduct of the decomposition of organic material in landfills. LFG is composed of roughly 50 percent methane (the primary component of natural gas), 50 percent carbon dioxide (CO2) and a small amount of non-methane organic compounds.
