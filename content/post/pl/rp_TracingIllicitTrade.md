[Plastic for profit: Tracing illicit plastic waste flows, supply chains and actors](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GITOC-Plastic-for-Profit.pdf)
To achieve a Net-Zero future, it is essential – among other interventions – to manage and control the indiscriminate use of plastic and the way it is disposed of once it becomes waste. Confronting the trade in plastic waste is also {{< hl-text blue>}}an issue of climate justice{{< /hl-text >}}, as the by-products aggravate health and environmental harms in lower-income countries and among communities that lack the political leverage to reject this waste.

# 1. Executive Summary
* Now, {{< hl-text blue>}}South East Asia{{< /hl-text >}} has become by far the largest recipient of waste from Europe and North America as well as from Australia.
* In addition, the role of {{< hl-text blue>}}African countries{{< /hl-text >}} as receiving destinations is growing for both {{< hl-text blue>}}the North American and European waste trade{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Plastic waste, that once processed, becomes raw material to be sold to manufacturing companies. However, many of these receiving countries only possess basic recycling facilities and therefore are unable to process {{< hl-text blue>}}mixed or hazardous waste{{< /hl-text >}}, which is eventually {{< hl-text blue>}}dumped or burnt{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The populations of developing and emerging economies in Africa and Asia are the most affected, and workers in those countries have to contend with {{< hl-text blue>}}unsanitary and exploitative working conditions{{< /hl-text >}} in sorting and recycling plants.
* Legitimate recycling companies and waste brokers have engaged in the {{< hl-text blue>}}misdeclaration{{< /hl-text >}} of the content of containers and their origin; the {{< hl-text blue>}}concealment{{< /hl-text >}} of illicit waste among other goods; {{< hl-text blue>}}illegal dumping and incineration{{< /hl-text >}}; and money
laundering and corruption to {{< hl-text blue>}}circumvent{{< /hl-text >}} import and export bans and regulations.
* Often with stops in other parts of the world such as Turkey or eastern Europe.
* Although many European countries have advanced recycling facilities, they cannot handle all of the waste produced domestically.

# 2. WASTE COLONIALISM AND EXPLOITATION

However, like all other highly lucrative businesses, waste management has long attracted the attention of criminals and of legitimate business operators adopting fraudulent practices such as misdeclaring the content of containers, money laundering, financial crime and corruption to maximize their profits.

## The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
* The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a sharp rise in the consumption of single-use plastic, from {{< hl-text blue>}}medical equipment{{< /hl-text >}} to {{< hl-text blue>}}takeaway food packaging{{< /hl-text >}}, which has not been matched by increased recycling capacity.
* In 2020, the US produced a year’s worth of plastic waste in just two months. And in Thailand, generation of plastic waste jumped by 50% following the outbreak, with food-delivery packaging representing a sizeable share.
* Meanwhile, as the pandemic took hold, the recycling sector was affected by disruptions, staff shortages and a deprioritization of recycling.
* The world registered a 280% increase in illegal plastic-waste disposal in 2020. UK seeing a 300% increase in so-called fly-tipping (illegal dumping)

# 3. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Two types of illegal activities related to waste: illegal trade,
which violates import or export bans; and illegal treatment, in the forms of illegal disposal, incineration or recycling.
## International conventions
* The Basel Convention was adopted in 1989 in response to developing regions being used as dumping grounds for foreign waste in the 1980s.
* To date, 187 countries and the European Union (EU) are parties to it; notably, the US is not among them.
* European Commission adopted a new set of rules in December 2020. EU countries can now only export to non-OECD destinations {{< hl-text blue>}}‘clean plastic waste’{{< /hl-text >}} for recycling and are banned from shipping {{< hl-text blue>}}hazardous or hard-to-recycle plastic waste{{< /hl-text >}} to non-OECD countries.
* Export activities considered illegal in Europe are compliant with US legislation.
## Illegal traffic under the Basel Convention
## China’s ‘National Sword’ policy
As a result of the ban, countries such as {{< hl-text blue>}}Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines{{< /hl-text >}}, along with many others, became the new recycling destinations for most North American and European plastic waste, despite the fact they often lacked adequate disposal facilities and sufficient law enforcement capacity.
## Other national-level bans and the trend in U-turns
> For example, in July 2021, largely compelled by a Greenpeace investigation that uncovered that most imported plastic waste was not recycled, **Turkey** introduced a ban on the imports of PET, HDPE and LDPE plastics. However, in less than two weeks, PET was removed from the list of banned imports. The move was symptomatic of the tensions between the country’s ministry of environment wanting a total ban and the ministry of trade advocating for openness, and is the by-product of the narrative that, at times of financial crisis, waste management and processing are needed to generate revenue.

> In **Thailand**, plans to ban imports of plastic waste by September 2020 were postponed by five years, with critics arguing that this was aimed at securing a steady flow of waste needed to feed Thailand’s recycling industry, driven by an ever-growing number of Chinese companies.

> Following a 2019 ban on all waste imports, **Indonesia** also softened its stance. The year after, the government allowed the imports of plastic (and paper) waste with contamination levels of up to 2%. This particular case highlights the role of one particular set of actors: trade associations. The US Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) openly lobbied for the continuation of imports of a number of waste materials.

> If these requests are met, **Kenya** – which has the strictest ban on single-use plastics in the world34 – could become the main hub for the distribution of US-made plastic in the continent.

# 4. HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HARM
* Much of the waste that is exported for recycling to South East Asia is often burned or dumped.
* The degree to which the illicit trade in plastic waste severely undermines both the natural environment and human health and safety is alarming.
* All this waste eventually feeds the five infamous garbage patches that float in our oceans, of which the so-called {{< hl-text blue>}}Great Pacific Garbage Patch{{< /hl-text >}} is the largest.
* Aside from dumping, it has become common practice to burn illicit waste as a method of disposal in Indonesia or Malaysia, causing {{< hl-text blue>}}air pollution, respiratory problems, and food health problems (ashes){{< /hl-text >}}.

> Burning is also used as a method of illicit waste disposal in some European countries such as **Italy** and the **UK**, as well as in **Turkey**. In October 2021, Italian authorities arrested the owners of a recycling plant who, in 2017, set ablaze tonnes of mixed hazardous waste as a way of clearing their premises at no cost.

> In **Turkey**, an average of two suspicious incinerations per week take place at recycling plants.

> The exploitation of vulnerable workers has also been documented in **Indonesia**, where some companies systematically employ women to sort waste (with no concerns for any resulting health problems).

> **Ghana**’s Environmental Protection Agency told the GI-TOC that most recycling facilities in the country (primarily owned by **Chinese entrepreneurs**) have unsanitary working conditions. A similar picture emerged in **Zambia**, where Chinese companies appear to underpay their workers.

> In **Indonesia** and the **Philippines**, waste pickers and workers in collection and aggregation facilities generally do not have formal employment contracts with the owners of the facilities and thus lack access to basic benefits, training and protections vital to their safety. Most waste pickers also do not have identification documents, a prerequisite for accessing government health-insurance schemes.

## THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH
46% of the total mass is made of {{< hl-text blue>}}discarded fishing gear{{< /hl-text >}}.
