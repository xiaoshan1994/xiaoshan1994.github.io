[Plastic for profit: Tracing illicit plastic waste flows, supply chains and actors](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GITOC-Plastic-for-Profit.pdf)
To achieve a Net-Zero future, it is essential – among other interventions – to manage and control the indiscriminate use of plastic and the way it is disposed of once it becomes waste. Confronting the trade in plastic waste is also {{< hl-text blue>}}an issue of climate justice{{< /hl-text >}}, as the by-products aggravate health and environmental harms in lower-income countries and among communities that lack the political leverage to reject this waste.

# Executive Summary
* Now, South East Asia has become by far the
largest recipient of waste from Europe and North America as well as from Australia.
* In addition, the role of African countries as receiving destinations is growing for both the North American and European waste trade.
* Plastic waste, that once processed, becomes raw material to be sold to manufacturing companies. {{< hl-text orange>}}However, many of these receiving countries only possess basic recycling facilities and therefore are unable to process {{< hl-text blue>}}mixed or hazardous waste{{< /hl-text >}}, which is eventually {{< hl-text blue>}}dumped or burnt{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The populations of developing and emerging economies in Africa and Asia are the most affected, and workers in those countries have to contend with {{< hl-text blue>}}unsanitary and exploitative working conditions{{< /alert >}} in sorting and recycling plants.
