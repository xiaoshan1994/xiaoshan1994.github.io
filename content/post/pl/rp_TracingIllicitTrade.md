[Plastic for profit: Tracing illicit plastic waste flows, supply chains and actors](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GITOC-Plastic-for-Profit.pdf)
To achieve a Net-Zero future, it is essential – among other interventions – to manage and control the indiscriminate use of plastic and the way it is disposed of once it becomes waste. Confronting the trade in plastic waste is also {{< hl-text blue>}}an issue of climate justice{{< /hl-text >}}, as the by-products aggravate health and environmental harms in lower-income countries and among communities that lack the political leverage to reject this waste.

# 1. Executive Summary
* Now, {{< hl-text blue>}}South East Asia{{< /hl-text >}} has become by far the largest recipient of waste from Europe and North America as well as from Australia.
* In addition, the role of {{< hl-text blue>}}African countries{{< /hl-text >}} as receiving destinations is growing for both {{< hl-text blue>}}the North American and European waste trade{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Plastic waste, that once processed, becomes raw material to be sold to manufacturing companies. However, many of these receiving countries only possess basic recycling facilities and therefore are unable to process {{< hl-text blue>}}mixed or hazardous waste{{< /hl-text >}}, which is eventually {{< hl-text blue>}}dumped or burnt{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The populations of developing and emerging economies in Africa and Asia are the most affected, and workers in those countries have to contend with {{< hl-text blue>}}unsanitary and exploitative working conditions{{< /hl-text >}} in sorting and recycling plants.
* Legitimate recycling companies and waste brokers have engaged in the {{< hl-text blue>}}misdeclaration{{< /hl-text >}} of the content of containers and their origin; the {{< hl-text blue>}}concealment{{< /hl-text >}} of illicit waste among other goods; {{< hl-text blue>}}illegal dumping and incineration{{< /hl-text >}}; and money
laundering and corruption to {{< hl-text blue>}}circumvent{{< /hl-text >}} import and export bans and regulations.
* Often with stops in other parts of the world such as Turkey or eastern Europe.
* Although many European countries have advanced recycling facilities, they cannot handle all of the waste produced domestically.

# 2. WASTE COLONIALISM AND EXPLOITATION

However, like all other highly lucrative businesses, waste management has long attracted the attention of criminals and of legitimate business operators adopting fraudulent practices such as misdeclaring the content of containers, money laundering, financial crime and corruption to maximize their profits.

## The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
* The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a sharp rise in the consumption of single-use plastic, from {{< hl-text blue>}}medical equipment{{< /hl-text >}} to {{< hl-text blue>}}takeaway food packaging{{< /hl-text >}}, which has not been matched by increased recycling capacity.
* In 2020, the US produced a year’s worth of plastic waste in just two months. And in Thailand, generation of plastic waste jumped by 50% following the outbreak, with food-delivery packaging representing a sizeable share.
* Meanwhile, as the pandemic took hold, the recycling sector was affected by disruptions, staff shortages and a deprioritization of recycling.
* The world registered a 280% increase in illegal plastic-waste disposal in 2020. UK seeing a 300% increase in so-called fly-tipping (illegal dumping)

# 3. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Two types of illegal activities related to waste: illegal trade,
which violates import or export bans; and illegal treatment, in the forms of illegal disposal, incineration or recycling.
## International conventions
* The Basel Convention was adopted in 1989 in response to developing regions being used as dumping grounds for foreign waste in the 1980s.
* To date, 187 countries and the European Union (EU) are parties to it; notably, the US is not among them.
* European Commission adopted a new set of rules in December 2020. EU countries can now only export to non-OECD destinations {{< hl-text blue>}}‘clean plastic waste’{{< /hl-text >}} for recycling and are banned from shipping {{< hl-text blue>}}hazardous or hard-to-recycle plastic waste{{< /hl-text >}} to non-OECD countries.
* Export activities considered illegal in Europe are compliant with US legislation.
## Illegal traffic under the Basel Convention
## China’s ‘National Sword’ policy
As a result of the ban, countries such as {{< hl-text blue>}}Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines{{< /hl-text >}}, along with many others, became the new recycling destinations for most North American and European plastic waste, despite the fact they often lacked adequate disposal facilities and sufficient law enforcement capacity.
## Other national-level bans and the trend in U-turns
> For example, in July 2021, largely compelled by a Greenpeace investigation that uncovered that most imported plastic waste was not recycled, **Turkey** introduced a ban on the imports of PET, HDPE and LDPE plastics. However, in less than two weeks, PET was removed from the list of banned imports. The move was symptomatic of the tensions between the country’s ministry of environment wanting a total ban and the ministry of trade advocating for openness, and is the by-product of the narrative that, at times of financial crisis, waste management and processing are needed to generate revenue.

> In **Thailand**, plans to ban imports of plastic waste by September 2020 were postponed by five years, with critics arguing that this was aimed at securing a steady flow of waste needed to feed Thailand’s recycling industry, driven by an ever-growing number of Chinese companies.

> Following a 2019 ban on all waste imports, **Indonesia** also softened its stance. The year after, the government allowed the imports of plastic (and paper) waste with contamination levels of up to 2%. This particular case highlights the role of one particular set of actors: trade associations. The US Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) openly lobbied for the continuation of imports of a number of waste materials.

> If these requests are met, **Kenya** – which has the strictest ban on single-use plastics in the world34 – could become the main hub for the distribution of US-made plastic in the continent.

# 4. HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HARM
* Much of the waste that is exported for recycling to South East Asia is often burned or dumped.
* The degree to which the illicit trade in plastic waste severely undermines both the natural environment and human health and safety is alarming.
* All this waste eventually feeds the five infamous garbage patches that float in our oceans, of which the so-called {{< hl-text blue>}}Great Pacific Garbage Patch{{< /hl-text >}} is the largest.
* Aside from dumping, it has become common practice to burn illicit waste as a method of disposal in Indonesia or Malaysia, causing {{< hl-text blue>}}air pollution, respiratory problems, and food health problems (ashes){{< /hl-text >}}.

> Burning is also used as a method of illicit waste disposal in some European countries such as **Italy** and the **UK**, as well as in **Turkey**. In October 2021, Italian authorities arrested the owners of a recycling plant who, in 2017, set ablaze tonnes of mixed hazardous waste as a way of clearing their premises at no cost.

> In **Turkey**, an average of two suspicious incinerations per week take place at recycling plants.

> The exploitation of vulnerable workers has also been documented in **Indonesia**, where some companies systematically employ women to sort waste (with no concerns for any resulting health problems).

> **Ghana**’s Environmental Protection Agency told the GI-TOC that most recycling facilities in the country (primarily owned by **Chinese entrepreneurs**) have unsanitary working conditions. A similar picture emerged in **Zambia**, where Chinese companies appear to underpay their workers.

> In **Indonesia** and the **Philippines**, waste pickers and workers in collection and aggregation facilities generally do not have formal employment contracts with the owners of the facilities and thus lack access to basic benefits, training and protections vital to their safety. Most waste pickers also do not have identification documents, a prerequisite for accessing government health-insurance schemes.

## THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH
46% of the total mass is made of {{< hl-text blue>}}discarded fishing gear{{< /hl-text >}}.

# 5. TRACING THE FLOWS
* Illicit plastic waste is transported around the world along multiple routes from {{< hl-text blue>}}North America{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}Europe{{< /hl-text >}} to {{< hl-text blue>}}South East Asia{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}other parts of Asia{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}Africa{{< /hl-text >}}.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Turkey{{< /hl-text >}} has become a key node for the trade in European plastic waste owing to its permissive environment, an appetite for receiving and processing foreign waste to {{< hl-text blue>}}generate revenue{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}the presence of criminal groups{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Underlying drivers：1. the US and the EU simply do not have sufficient capacity to recycle domestically；2. The cost of exporting waste abroad is dramatically lower than the cost of setting up new facilities.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}More compelling economic consideration is that producing virgin plastic is often more affordable than its recycled equivalent.{{< /hl-text >}} (the global plastics-recycling market is going to struggle to be competitive in the face of cheaper and often better-quality raw plastic.)

> Crucially, the shale gas boom in the US is driving the cheap production of fossil fuels, including gases such as ethylene and propylene, which are the two most important plastic feedstocks.

* Where next? Eastern Europe (specifically {{< hl-text blue>}}Romania{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}Bulgaria{{< /hl-text >}}) could be a potential destination. {{< hl-text blue>}}Laos{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}Myanmar{{< /hl-text >}}, where there have already been some detections, should be ones to watch. Looking further into the future, flows towards {{< hl-text blue>}}African countries (Zambia){{< /hl-text >}} are likely to increase.

> According to **Romanian** authorities, organized crime groups are involved in the illicit trade of hazardous and unrecyclable plastics. **Poland** also receives waste from EU countries and the UK that is misdeclared as ‘recyclable’ (already sorted plastic that is, in fact, mixed with banned waste) and ends up being illegally dumped or burnt.

| Origin    | Destination     | Transit     | Notes           |
|---------- |-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Canada  | Indonesia  |     | Indonesia has returned waste to Canada |
| Canada  | Malaysia   |     | Butterworth, Canada’s second-largest port, has been identified as a main departure hub for illegal plastic waste from the country to South East Asia. Malaysia has been returning illegal waste to Canada. |
| Canada  | The Philippines |   | The illegal shipping of plastic waste from Canada to the Philippines has long been a source of diplomatic tensions between the two countries, including around the repatriation of unwanted cargo and responsibility for covering associated costs. |
| United States | India | Indonesia | India has been used as an alternative destination for unwanted US waste that Indonesia intended to return to origin.|
| United States | Indonesia | Hong Kong | Despite the lack of official data, it is believed that ‘lots’ of US plastic is illicitly shipped to Indonesia and, starting in 2019, the latter has become more vocal with its complaints and determined to repatriate unwanted waste.70 Large amounts of re-exported waste are diverted to third countries.|
| United States | Malaysia | Hong Kong | There is no official comprehensive US data recording the new destinations of US plastic waste following the introduction of the Chinese ban.72 However, the state of California accounts for nearly a third of all US exports to non-OECD countries and this is the main origin of illicit waste into Malaysia (which became number one destination after the introduction of the import ban in China).|
| United States | Thailand |  | Thailand saw the largest increase of imports immediately following the introduction of China’s import ban. 90% of plastics transit through the deep-water port of Laem Chabang. |
| United States   | The Philippines  | | In the post-National Sword era, exports to the Philippines grew exponentially, especially from Japan and the US.|
| United States   | Cambodia  |    | Multiple seizures of illegal plastic waste were recorded at Sihanoukville port in 2019. A Cambodia-based Chinese company was deemed responsible for importing the cargoes from the US and Canada.|
| Canada, United States, Europe |Ghana |    | The ports of Tema and Accra and the inland city of Kumasi are hubs for illicit plastic waste. Ghana has long been a recipient of e-waste and there are suspicions that illicit plastic waste is exported to Ghana mixed with e-waste.77 |
| North America, Europe | Pakistan  |           | Pakistan is a net importer as local plastic production is limited to meeting national demand. It has become common for shipments to South East Asian countries to be redirected to Pakistan. |
| Europe | Myanmar |      | Most plastic waste arrives at Yangon port. Myanmar then exports mainly PET flakes and some HDPE/PP resins to neighbouring countries. Recycled HDPE and PP are mainly consumed locally.|
| Belgium | Malaysia | Hong Kong | Reports indicate the shipping of illegal waste from Belgium to Malaysia that had been disguised as exports from Hong Kong, a widely used transit hub.|
| France | Malaysia  |   | The shipping of illicit plastic waste to Malaysia came to the fore when a French brokerage firm received a heavy fine – the first instance of this kind in France.|
| Germany  | Turkey     | Belgium     | As of June 2021, over 100 illicit containers that had reached Turkey from Germany via the port of Antwerp were sitting in Turkey waiting to be sent back to Germany. They contained mixed waste contaminated with household waste.  |
| Italy  | Malaysia  |    | The Italy–Kuala Lumpur route is believed to be a significant route for illegal shipping of waste. Companies are believed to rely on Hong Kong-based agents who would, on paper, broker shipments to Hong Kong when, in reality, illegal plastic waste would arrive directly in Malaysia. |
| Italy   | Tunisia |   | Italy’s Campania region has been identified as the point of origin of hundreds of containers full of mixed municipal waste that were directed to the Port of Sousse in Tunisia in 2020.8  |
| Spain     | Malaysia |   | Malaysia has repatriated illegal waste back to Spain, Japan and Singapore.  |
| Spain    | South Africa  |      | Disposal sites in KwaZulu-Natal and Cape Town are the most affected by illicit plastic waste. |
| United Kingdom  | Malaysia | Turkey | Turkey (39%) and Malaysia (12%) are the top two destinations for illicit plastic waste from the UK. Both have limited capacity to recycle, and illegal dumping and burning are widespread.|
| United Kingdom | Malaysia  | The Netherlands  | UK-origin plastic waste is sent for recycling to the Netherlands, where it is instead mixed with Dutch waste and then shipped to countries that no longer accept British plastic. As of 2021, evidence shows continued shipping from Dutch ports to non-OECD countries. |
| United Kingdom | Poland  |     | Poland is the third-largest recipient of illicit plastic waste from the UK.  |
| United Kingdom   | South Africa  |   | South Africa has witnessed the illegal dumping of containers full of unlawful plastic waste from the UK, Spain and other European countries.|
| United Kingdom | Turkey |    | The Cilicia region of Turkey, from the Mediterranean to the Syrian border, is the main entry point for plastic waste and a highly polluted area. |
| Mozambique  | South Africa |    | Truckloads of plastic mixed with e-waste enter South Africa and are suspected to then be shipped abroad.  |
| South Africa | Portugal, Italy, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Pakistan |      | South Africa is both an importer and exporter of illegal plastic waste.   Multiple shipments to international destinations have been recorded in 2020   and 2021.|
| Japan, Singapore | Malaysia |        | Malaysia has repatriated illegal waste back to Spain, Japan and   Singapore. |
| Japan | The Philippines  |  | Japan has a history of shipping toxic and hazardous waste to the Philippines, but Tokyo’s repatriation of waste containers has won it praise from the Filipino government.  |
| South Korea   | The Philippines  |     | Investigations by Greenpeace identified large amounts of mixed and hazardous waste (declared as plastic synthetic flakes) that had reached the Philippines from South Korea. A Korean company was the consignee of the shipment.|
| Australia  | Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam|  | Post 2017, Australian plastic waste was redirected to Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. Indonesia’s East Java province has received millions of kilograms of illegal plastic and contaminated mixed waste  |
| Unknown| Indonesia | Marshall Islands | Masked as the country of origin of illegal plastic waste, the Marshall Islands are believed to be used as transit countries for waste coming from Western countries. Owing to this misdeclaration of origin, in 2018 it appeared that Indonesia was importing double the amount of plastic waste from the Marshall Islands than it was from the US. |
| Unknown | Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines | Hong Kong | All three destination countries have speculated that illicit plastic waste arriving from Hong Kong had actually originated elsewhere.|
