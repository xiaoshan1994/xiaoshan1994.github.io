[Plastic for profit: Tracing illicit plastic waste flows, supply chains and actors](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GITOC-Plastic-for-Profit.pdf)
To achieve a Net-Zero future, it is essential – among other interventions – to manage and control the indiscriminate use of plastic and the way it is disposed of once it becomes waste. Confronting the trade in plastic waste is also {{< hl-text blue>}}an issue of climate justice{{< /hl-text >}}, as the by-products aggravate health and environmental harms in lower-income countries and among communities that lack the political leverage to reject this waste.

# Executive Summary
* Now, {{< hl-text blue>}}South East Asia{{< /hl-text >}} has become by far the largest recipient of waste from Europe and North America as well as from Australia.
* In addition, the role of {{< hl-text blue>}}African countries{{< /hl-text >}} as receiving destinations is growing for both {{< hl-text blue>}}the North American and European waste trade{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Plastic waste, that once processed, becomes raw material to be sold to manufacturing companies. However, many of these receiving countries only possess basic recycling facilities and therefore are unable to process {{< hl-text blue>}}mixed or hazardous waste{{< /hl-text >}}, which is eventually {{< hl-text blue>}}dumped or burnt{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The populations of developing and emerging economies in Africa and Asia are the most affected, and workers in those countries have to contend with {{< hl-text blue>}}unsanitary and exploitative working conditions{{< /hl-text >}} in sorting and recycling plants.
* Legitimate recycling companies and waste brokers have engaged in the {{< hl-text blue>}}misdeclaration{{< /hl-text >}} of the content of containers and their origin; the {{< hl-text blue>}}concealment{{< /hl-text >}} of illicit waste among other goods; {{< hl-text blue>}}illegal dumping and incineration{{< /hl-text >}}; and money
laundering and corruption to {{< hl-text blue>}}circumvent{{< /hl-text >}} import and export bans and regulations.
