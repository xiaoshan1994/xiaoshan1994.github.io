## Market Study for Malaysia: Plastics Circularity Opportunities and Barriers

Three Key Quantitative Findings on {{< hl-text blue>}}Collected For Recycling (CFR) Rates{{< /hl-text >}} and Material Value Loss
Malaysia recycled about **{{< hl-text blue>}}24%{{< /hl-text >}}** of the key plastic resins in 2019.
> In 2019, 1.41 million tonnes per year (TPY) of the four key resins assessed in this study (PET, HDPE, LDPE and PP) were consumed in Malaysia, out of which an estimated 334,000 TPY (24%) were recycled.

* the JPSPN (National Solid Waste Management Department) recycling target for 2025 is {{< hl-text blue>}}40%{{< /hl-text >}}.

the Malaysia Sustainable Plastics Alliance (MaSPA) in 2019:
1. Identify and eliminate five problematic or unnecessary single-use plastic items through redesign, innovation or alternative (reuse) delivery models by 2025.
2. 100% of plastic packaging to be recyclable/reusable/compostable by 2030
3. 25% of post-consumer plastic packaging effectively recycled or composted by 2025.
4. 15% of average recycled content to be achieved across all plastic packaging by 2030.

* In Malaysia, much of the recycling happens separate from the SWM system via upstream diversion directly by the {{< hl-text blue>}}informal sector{{< /hl-text >}} (e.g. waste pickers, collectors, junk shops and waste aggregators) leading to a parallel economy for recyclables collection.

* This study categorizes the plastic resins into either {{< hl-text blue>}}packaging{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}non-packaging applications{{< /hl-text >}}.

MALAYSIA is on track to miss its 2020 targets to divert 40% of waste from landfill and increase recycling rates to 22%.

According to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in Malaysia, around RM430m (US$100m) has been spent on {{< hl-text blue>}}closing just 17 out of 165 existing dumpsites{{< /hl-text >}}, and promoting the disposal of solid waste to sanitary landfill.

According to the most recent stats available, almost {{< hl-text blue>}}90%{{< /hl-text >}} of waste was reportedly disposed to {{< hl-text blue>}}sanitary landfills{{< /hl-text >}}, while only {{< hl-text blue>}}10.5%{{< /hl-text >}} was {{< hl-text blue>}}recycled{{< /hl-text >}}.

That being said, {{< hl-text blue>}}landfill{{< /hl-text >}}is the favoured form of solid waste management in Malaysia, with {{< hl-text blue>}}85 percent{{< /hl-text >}} of material going to landfill; this high percentage stems from the low cost of this form of solid waste management.

In Malaysia, {{< hl-text blue>}}50%{{< /hl-text >}} of landfills are open dumping sites; 30% use-controlled tipping; 12% are controlled landfills with daily cover; {{< hl-text blue>}}5%{{< /hl-text >}} are sanitary landfills without leachate treatment facility; and the other {{< hl-text blue>}}5%{{< /hl-text >}} are sanitary landfills with leachate treatment.

## Malaysia is eyeing waste-to-energy solutions
https://www.greendkinsea.com/post/malaysia-is-eyeing-waste-to-energy-solutions
Malaysia’s first WTE plant in Ladang Tanah Merah, Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, which was scheduled to be fully operational in June 2020 is now delayed due to nationwide movement restrictions amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The Housing and Local Government Ministry of Malaysia aims at reducing solid waste disposed directly to landfills by promoting the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) lifestyle and introducing new and proven technologies such as plans to set up {{< hl-text blue>}}six{{< /hl-text >}} waste-to-energy (WtE) plants by 2025 with various technologies to be evaluated.

the non-sanitary landfill rate in Malaysia is 92.35 (based on site numbers)

## On the Frontline of Indonesia’s Plastic Waste Crisis
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/frontline-indonesias-plastic-waste-crisis

Indonesia’s National Plastic Action Partnership estimates that only {{< hl-text blue>}}10 percent{{< /hl-text >}} of Indonesia’s yearly 6.8 million tons of plastic waste is recycled and {{< hl-text blue>}}nearly half{{< /hl-text >}} is dumped or burned. Indonesia is responsible for 10 percent of global plastic leakage into the ocean, second only behind China.
