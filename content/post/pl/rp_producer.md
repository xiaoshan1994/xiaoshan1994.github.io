# THE FIVE MAJOR FINDINGS OF OUR REPORT
1. In 2019, just {{< hl-text blue>}}20 polymer producers{{< /hl-text >}} accounted for more than {{< hl-text blue>}}half of all{{< /hl-text >}} single-use plastic waste generated globally – and the top 100 accounted for 90 percent.
> ExxonMobil (/ˈeksɒn/in the US /ˈesəʊ/in the UK) and Dow – both based in the USA – and China-based Sinopec top the list, with these three companies together accounting for 16 percent of global single-use plastic waste. Of approximately 300 polymer producers operating globally, a small fraction hold the fate of the world’s plastics crisis in their hands: their choice to continue to produce virgin polymers, rather than recycled polymers, will have massive repercussions on how much waste is collected, is managed and leaks into the environment.

2. Major global investors and banks are enabling the single-use plastics crisis.
3. There has been a collective industry failure to transition away from fossil-fuel-based feedstocks.
4. Planned expansion of virgin polymer production capacity threatens to overwhelm hopes of a circular plastics economy.
5. Single-use plastic waste is an entrenched geopolitical problem.
# Recommendations
## POLYMER PRODUCERS
Polymer producers represent an extraordinary leverage opportunity in the fight against plastic pollution, as the “gatekeepers” of plastic production – particularly because they are relatively few in number. As policymakers and investors recognise this fact, the disruptions and risks facing these companies will only grow. Polymer producers wishing to maintain a competitive advantage should:
* Disclose levels of virgin versus recycled polymer production and their associated single-use plastic waste “footprint”.
* Quit paying lip service to sustainability and seize the opportunity to re-tool.
Set real, quantifiable /'kwɑntə,faɪəbl/ and time-bound commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuel feedstocks and shift to circular recycled polymers.
* Commit to using circularity measurement and reporting tools.
One example is the Circulytics initiative from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which supports a company’s transition towards the circular economy, and reveals the extent to which a company has achieved circularity across its entire operations.
## POLICYMAKERS
Solving the single-use plastic problem will take more than the actions of progressive polymer producers or the influence of capital markets. It will also require policymakers to display great political will and practical action. Policymakers should:
* Target policies at polymer producers
With the knowledge of which companies are at the source of the single-use plastic waste crisis, policymakers can now draft effective regulatory responses, such as policies that {{< hl-text blue>}}require recycled polymer production from plastic waste feedstocks{{< /hl-text >}}, and therefore incentivise greater waste collection; or {{< hl-text blue>}}economic incentives that accelerate the transition from virgin to recycled polymers{{< /hl-text >}}, such as {{< hl-text blue>}}a levy on virgin production{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Accelerate a global treaty on plastic pollution.
A Montreal Protocol or Paris Agreement-style treaty may be the only way to bring an end to plastic pollution worldwide. The treaty must address the problem at its source, with targets for the phasing out of fossil-fuel-based polymers and encouraging the development of a circular plastics economy.
* Require full disclosure from producers and users of single-use plastics in order to better monitor the supply chain.
Insist on “single-use plastic footprint” being {{< hl-text blue>}}a mandatory reporting metric{{< /hl-text >}} – as per the equivalents that are rapidly becoming mandatory in carbon accounting.
## INVESTORS AND BANKS
Institutional asset managers and global banks are providing billions of dollars to companies that produce polymers from fossil fuels – as much as 100 times more than they provide to companies trying to shift to a circular economy. This asymmetry urgently needs to be reversed. Investors and banks should:
* Disclose the level of lending and investment in virgin versus recycled polymer production and the associated generation of single-use plastic waste.
Shareholders and customers have a right to know if their money is being invested or lent to entities whose products have negative impacts on people and the planet – a measure of single-use plastic waste must be included in annual environmental, social and governance reporting.
* Commit to funding a circular plastics economy.
