# Introduction
* Plastic waste treatment methods and technologies vary between countries, likewise the environmental impacts of treating 1 kg of plastic waste have great disparity.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}The incineration and recycling rates in developed countries are generally much higher than those in developing countries with landfills as their main disposal means{{< /hl-text >}}, which implies that the changes in global plastic waste trade flow influence the already existing environmental impacts to a large extent.
* Sample countries included China, “{{< hl-text blue>}}17 countries (and regions){{< /hl-text >}}” which accounted for {{< hl-text blue>}}92%{{< /hl-text >}} of plastic waste imported to China, and “other countries”.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Environmental impacts{{< /hl-text >}} and the corresponding {{< hl-text blue>}}Eco-cost{{< /hl-text >}} of these changes in global plastic waste trade flow patterns through life cycle assessment (LCA).
* Fully took into account changes in the environmental impact due to {{< hl-text blue>}}technical differences among countries{{< /hl-text >}}, including {{< hl-text blue>}}diversities of technological structure and advancement{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Scenario Analysis (SA): (1) {{< hl-text blue>}}Export Reduction{{< /hl-text >}} Scenarios assuming plastic waste exports from developed and developing countries plunged by 50% jointly or singly against 2018 volume, and (2) {{< hl-text blue>}}Recycling Rate{{< /hl-text >}} Promotion Scenarios premise that the recycling rates of all countries are increased by 20%, 50%, and 100% compared to the 2018 scenario.
