# Introduction
* Plastic waste treatment methods and technologies vary between countries, likewise the environmental impacts of treating 1 kg of plastic waste have great disparity.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}The incineration and recycling rates in developed countries are generally much higher than those in developing countries with landfills as their main disposal means{{< /hl-text >}}, which implies that the changes in global plastic waste trade flow influence the already existing environmental impacts to a large extent.
* Sample countries included China, “{{< hl-text blue>}}17 countries (and regions){{< /hl-text >}}” which accounted for {{< hl-text blue>}}92%{{< /hl-text >}} of plastic waste imported to China, and “other countries”.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Environmental impacts{{< /hl-text >}} and the corresponding {{< hl-text blue>}}Eco-cost{{< /hl-text >}} of these changes in global plastic waste trade flow patterns through life cycle assessment (LCA).
* Fully took into account changes in the environmental impact due to {{< hl-text blue>}}technical differences among countries{{< /hl-text >}}, including {{< hl-text blue>}}diversities of technological structure and advancement{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Scenario Analysis (SA): (1) {{< hl-text blue>}}Export Reduction{{< /hl-text >}} Scenarios assuming plastic waste exports from developed and developing countries plunged by 50% jointly or singly against 2018 volume, and (2) {{< hl-text blue>}}Recycling Rate{{< /hl-text >}} Promotion Scenarios premise that the recycling rates of all countries are increased by 20%, 50%, and 100% compared to the 2018 scenario.
# Results
## Changes in plastic waste trade flow pattern
**Fig. 1: The trade flows of six types of plastic waste under two scenarios.**

a presents the global trade flows of six types of plastic waste prior to the ban (Baseline Scenario), while b presents the flows subsequent to the ban (2018 Scenario). The unit of the flows is tons. The data source of a and b is shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and  2. The flows of six types in the Figure are based on estimation (Supplementary Table 4).

* **Country list (7 country groups) in Sankey diagram**：{{< hl-text blue>}}China mainland and HK, Japan, USA, Europe 7, Southeast Asia 5, Rep. of Korea, and Mexico{{< /hl-text >}}.

* **Flow components (six plastic groups)**: {{< hl-text blue>}}PE, PS, PVC, PET, PP, and Other{{< /hl-text >}}.

* Before Ban, mainland China and HK imported 55.7% and 22% of global plastic waste, while USA, Japan, and Europe 7 exported 77.9%, 87.6%, and 57.5% of plastic waste to mainland China and HK.
* After Ban, {{< hl-text blue>}}Japan{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}the USA{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}Germany{{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}the UK{{< /hl-text >}}, accounted for 46.1% of the world trade flow of plastic waste. {{< hl-text blue>}}Malaysia{{< /hl-text >}} became the top export destination  (12.2% of the total) among 18 sample countries.
* In 18 countries, only {{< hl-text blue>}}China{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}Belgium{{< /hl-text >}} had increments in exports.
* Southeast Asia 5 became the major export destinations where proportions of flows rising from 4.34% to 55.9% for Japan, from 5.24% to 46.5% for the USA, and from 6.1% to 33.0% for Europe 7.
* The import flows of Southeast Asia 5 rose to 3.62 times that of the Baseline Scenario (Japan 25.8%, the USA 19.4%, Germany 11.7%, Hong Kong 10.3%, and the UK 9.8%.)
* An increase in intra-Europe flows.
* There may be a downward trend of plastic waste flows from developed countries to Southeast Asia after 2018.

{{< hl-text blue>}}Export dependence on the Chinese market (ED){{< /hl-text >}} is defined as the proportion of export flows to mainland China and Hong Kong in the total exports of a country under the Baseline Scenario. The bubble shape size indicates the total Baseline export flow of the countries, according to which countries are divided into four categories and identified by four colors.

* If a country relied heavily on the Chinese market, its trade structure would be vulnerable and easily influenced by abrupt changes such as the China ban.
