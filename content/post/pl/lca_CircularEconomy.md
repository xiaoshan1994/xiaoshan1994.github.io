# Abstract

*  Implementation of circular technologies in the plastics supply chain: {{< hl-text orange>}}(i) chemical and mechanical recycling, (ii) biomass utilization, and (iii) carbon capture and utilization (CCU)—to exchange the fossil carbon feedstock{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Our study shows that by combining recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU, net-zero GHG emission plastics could be achieved with lower energy demands and lower operational costs than those associated with current fossil-based production technologies combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS).
* We built and used a global bottom-up model for plastics production and waste treatment based on {{< hl-text blue>}}>400, mostly industrially validated, life-cycle assessment compliant and harmonized technology datasets{{< /hl-text >}} representing the life cycle of >90% of global plastics.
* We project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* Two scenarios for fossil-based plastic waste treatment: landfilling and energy recovery.
