Taiwan, Province of China Trade data
Created by Vysaul Nyirongo, last modified by Ana Mendoza on May 11, 2021

Q: I did not find **Taiwan** trade flow in COMTRADE database. Would it be possible for me to obtain the Taiwan import and export to these partner Hong Kong and Mainland China data from COMTRADE ?

A: For political reasons, the UN is not allowed to show trade statistics referring to Taiwan, Province of China. Yes, in the partner breakdown, Taiwan, Province of China, is included under "Other Asia, not elsewhere specified" (code 490). Data for "Other Asia, nes" is available only to international organizations. {{< hl-text orange>}}In principle, trade data for territories belonging to Asia, but not specified by country, could end up in code 490.{{< /hl-text >}}{{< hl-text blue>}} In practice, only trade of Taiwan, Province of China is included under this code, except for several countries (such as Saudi Arabia, which report all of their exports to unknown countries).{{< /hl-text >}} Trade data for Taiwan, Province of China are not included within China's trade.

https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/World+Trade+Flows%3A+1962-2000
> Note in particular that the NBER-UN country code for Taiwan is ‘454900’.  This code corresponds to the UN country code of  ‘458960’ and the UN country description of  ‘Asia Othr. NS’, so we are imputing Taiwan trade from that classified as ‘Asia other not specified’ by the United Nations

# FOB value vs CIF value

[Methodology Guide for UN Comtrade User on  UN Comtrade Upgrade 2019](https://comtrade.un.org/data/MethodologyGuideforComtradePlus.pdf)
**Box 2 . Implementation of CIF FOB Values in UN Comtrade Data Interface**
At the most basic data record, up to in three trade values could be presented according to following rules:
a) {{< hl-text blue>}}CIF value for imports{{< /hl-text >}} would be assigned to “CIF Value”.
b) When FOB value is reported for imports, it would be allocated to “FOB Value”.
c) {{< hl-text blue>}}FOB value for exports{{< /hl-text >}} would be allocated to “FOB Value”.
For users ’ convenience, a third (“primary”) trade value is generated by applying IMTS 2010 recommendation on valuation: if available CIF otherwise FOB for imports; FOB for exports, respectively.

https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.20/2020/mtg1/4.1_Globalization_TT_UNECE_valuation2020.pdf
 * System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) recommends recording of imports and exports of goods at FOB value[^fob].
 * the FOB valuation seems to not be fully reconciled with the general conceptual principle of recording output at basic prices[^ba]:
  - FOB valuation principle : goods are valued excluding freight and insurance services between the exporting and importing countries (i.e., at a point of uniform valuation).
  - basic price valuation principle : goods are valued at the **{{< hl-text blue>}}observed transaction price{{< /hl-text >}}** receivable by the producer (freight and insurance services are included or excluded depending on if these services are separately invoiced by the producer).
* Imports of goods are to be recorded in the supply and use tables at basic prices:
 - CIF to FOB adjustment is needed, if FOBtype data detailed by product group are not available for imports.

Balance of Payments and Int. Inv. Position Manual 6th ed. (BPM6)
* recommends recording of imports and exports of goods at FOB value:
 - principle for valuation of general merchandise: market value of goods, at the point of uniform valuation, that is at the customs frontier of the economy from which the goods are first exported (FOB).
 - allows for partitioning and rerouting of transactions when transaction prices (as agreed between exporters and importers) include varying amounts of distribution costs.  
* use International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS)[^imts] as main data source for goods:
 - IMTS use a CIF type valuation for imports.
 - to derive FOB values, it is necessary to exclude freight and insurance costs incurred between the customs frontier of the exporter and the customs frontier of the importer.
 - CIF to FOB adjustment should be obtained at a detailed level, and CIF to FOB ratios change over time.

For detailed examples of CIF to FOB adjustments and implications, see this pdf by [The United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/aeg/2020/M14_4_2_Import_Export_Valuation.pdf).

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was established in 1964 as an intergovernmental organization intended to promote the interests of developing states in world trade.

# UNCTAD
[UNCTAD](https://unctad.org/) is the part of the [**United Nations Secretariat**](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/secretariat) dealing with trade, investment, and development issues.
NCTAD was established by the **United Nations General Assembly** in 1964 and it reports to the **UN General Assembly** and **United Nations Economic and Social Council**.

### Outward processing
[From WCO](http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/instrument-and-tools/conventions/pf_revised_kyoto_conv/kyoto_new/spanf.aspx)
{{< hl-text orange>}}Goods in free circulation in a Customs territory may be temporarily exported for manufacturing, processing or repair abroad and then re-imported with total or partial exemption (/ɪɡ'zempʃn/) (or total or partial relief) from import duties and taxes.{{< /hl-text >}}

[Outward processing from EU commission](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures-import-and-export/what-exportation/outward-processing_en)
Outward processing means that Union goods may be {{< hl-text blue>}}temporarily exported{{< /hl-text >}} from the customs territory of the Union in order to {{< hl-text blue>}}undergo processing operations{{< /hl-text >}}. The processed products resulting from these goods can be re-imported and released for free circulation with {{< hl-text blue>}}total or partial relief from import duty{{< /hl-text >}}. {{< hl-text orange>}}A total relief from import duties must be granted when the goods have been exported merely to be repaired free of charge because of a {{< hl-text blue>}}contractual obligation{{< /hl-text >}} or because of {{< hl-text blue>}}a manufacturing or material defect{{< /hl-text >}}.{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}In other cases of outward processing, the import duties on the re-imported products are calculated only on the basis of the value resulting from {{< hl-text blue>}}the processing operation{{< /hl-text >}} undertaken outside the customs territory of the Union.{{< /hl-text >}}

Outward processing procedure is designed to give businesses the possibility to take advantage of benefits such as {{< hl-text blue>}}lower labour costs{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}specific technical expertise{{< /hl-text >}} in non-EU countries.

[Inward processing from EU commission](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/customs-procedures-import-and-export/what-importation/inward-processing_en)

### Inward processing
[From WCO](http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/instrument-and-tools/conventions/pf_revised_kyoto_conv/kyoto_new/spanf.aspx)
{{< hl-text orange>}}Goods can be brought into a Customs territory conditionally relieved from payment of import duties and taxes, on the basis that such goods are intended for manufacturing, processing or repair and subsequent exportation.{{< /hl-text >}}

Inward processing means that {{< hl-text blue>}}non-Union goods{{< /hl-text >}} are imported in order to be used in the customs territory of the Union in {{< hl-text blue>}}one or more processing operations{{< /hl-text >}}, for instance, for the purposes of {{< hl-text blue>}}manufacturing or repair{{< /hl-text >}}. {{< hl-text orange>}}When imported, such goods are not subject to: Import duty, other taxes related to their import, such as VAT and/or excises, and commercial policy measures.{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Inward processing procedure is designed to give businesses the possibility to process goods imported from outside the customs territory of the Union even before they decide, according to logistical, commercial or other conditions, whether to sell the finished products within the Union or outside.{{< /hl-text >}} The inward processing procedure can also be used for goods which just have to undergo standard forms of handling intended to preserve them, improve their appearance or marketable quality or prepare them for distribution or resale.

After the processing operations, the processed products can be either re-exported or released for free circulation in the EU; {{< hl-text orange>}}the latter (free circulation) would imply the obligation to pay import duty and taxes, as well as the application of commercial policy measures.{{< /hl-text >}} In addition, it is also possible to store processed products under customs warehousing or in a free zone.

### Intra-firm trade
International flows of goods and services between parent companies and their affiliates or among these affiliates.

### About free zones
[*Practical Guidance on Free Zones* by World Customs Organization December 2020](http://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/facilitation/activities-and-programmes/free-zone/wco-fz-guidance_en.pdf?la=en)

> FZs attract not only legitimate business, but also illicit activities that take advantage of regulatory exemptions in FZs and the lack of oversight therein. Such illicit activities include money laundering, tax evasion and trade in counterfeit goods or other illicit goods, such as drugs, weapons, cultural heritage, fake medicines and even environmental waste.

> Customs should establish basic construction standards and other standards to be implemented in FZs for Customs control. This covers Customs checkpoints, enclosed fencing surrounding the FZ, Customs inspection areas, video surveillance systems, installation of non-intrusive inspection (NII) equipment, the information network to be interfaced with Customs, etc.

The following factors contributing to risks associated with Free Zones:
* Relaxed controls inside FZ
* Insufficient Customs' involvement in the operation of FZ
* Ease in setting up companies inside FZ
* Insufficient integration of Information Technology(IT) systems by governmental agencies inside FZ.

### Rules of Origin
[WTO](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/roi_e/roi_info_e.htm#:~:text=Rules%20of%20origin%20are%20the,to%20the%20rules%20of%20origin.)
Rules of origin are the criteria needed to determine {{< hl-text blue>}}the national source of a product{{< /hl-text >}}. Their importance is derived from the fact that duties and restrictions in several cases depend upon the source of imports.

While the requirement of substantial transformation is universally recognized, some governments apply the criterion of change of tariff classification, others the ad valorem percentage criterion and yet others the criterion of manufacturing or processing operation.

Rules of origin are used:
— to implement measures and instruments of commercial policy such as {{< hl-text blue>}}anti-dumping duties and safeguard measures{{< /hl-text >}};
— to determine whether imported products shall receive {{< hl-text blue>}}most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}preferential treatment{{< /hl-text >}};
— for the purpose of trade statistics;
— for the application of labelling and marking requirements; and
— for government procurement.

# Differences between Imports and Exports, Reporters and Partners
https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/Differences+between+Imports+and+Exports%2C+Reporters+and+Partners
Q: What are the differences between Imports and Exports, Reporters and Partners?

A: "Reporter" is the country (or area) which reports the trade data to us.

A "Partner" is the country or area from/to which the commodity was imported or exported, as declared by the reporting country.

There are many valid reasons why the reported exports of the USA may not coincide with the reported imports of Mexico. The main reason, in this case, is probably the different valuation of imports and exports.

Valuation. Imports are generally reported on Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) basis, while exports are reported on a Free on Board (FOB) basis. For this reason, {{< hl-text orange>}}import values tend to be higher than export values{{< /hl-text >}}.

Looking at the reported data of Durum Wheat over the last 4 or 5 years, it seems that the correspondence between USA exports and Mexico imports is, in fact, very good. The CIF/FOB factor explains why import values are higher, and other minor differences may just be due to differences in time of recording.

**Imports, Exports and Mirror Data with UN COMTRADE**

In a perfect world, country A reported imports from country B would match with country B reported exports to country A. Consequently, this would make mirroring (using information from the partner when a country does not report its trade) a transparent and error-free process.

However, this is not the case for the following reasons:

{{< hl-text orange>}}In UN COMTRADE, imports are recorded cif (cost insurance and freight) while exports are fob (free on board). This may represent a 10% to 20% difference.{{< /hl-text >}}
Despite all efforts made by national and international agencies, data quality may vary among countries.
**{{< hl-text orange>}}For a given country, imports are usually recorded with more accuracy than exports because imports generally generate tariff revenues while exports don't.{{< /hl-text >}}**
{{< hl-text orange>}}At a detailed level, a same good may be recorded in different categories by the exporter and the importer.{{< /hl-text >}}
For example, in 2001 Pakistan reported US$ 236 millions exports to China while China was reporting US$ 557 millions.

There will be cases where you can't avoid using mirror data. In such cases, it is recommended to use reporters for which you believe statistics are the most accurate and to keep using the same reporter for the full period if you build time series. For example, if Rwanda's imports from USA are missing for some selected years and you want a complete time series, it is better to rely on USA exports to Rwanda for each and every year, even if Rwanda's imports from USA is available for some of them. Otherwise, year to year trade value variations may reflect a shift from USA to Rwanda as a reporter rather than actual variations in trade flows.

# Gross Imports vs Re-imports and Gross Exports vs Re-exports in UN COMTRADE
In addition to gross imports, UNSD recently introduced re-imports as trade flow. {{< hl-text orange>}}Re-imports is included in gross imports{{< /hl-text >}}. In addition to Gross Exports, UNSD also records a flow called Re-exports (included in exports).


[^fob]: The abbreviation CIF stands for "cost, insurance and freight," and FOB means "free on board."
[^ba]: [The basic price](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=189) is the amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output {{< hl-text orange>}}minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable{{< /hl-text >}}, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; {{< hl-text orange>}}it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer{{< /hl-text >}}.
