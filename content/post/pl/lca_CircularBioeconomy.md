* The recovery of plastics through {{< hl-text blue>}}chemical recycling{{< /hl-text >}}—polymer recycling into their constituting repeat units or monomers (and oligomers)—and the development of {{< hl-text blue>}}bio-based and biodegradable alternatives{{< /hl-text >}} have gained increasing attention.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Biodegradability{{< /hl-text >}} tends to be perceived as more sustainable over {{< hl-text blue>}}(mechanical) recyclability {{< /hl-text >}}by consumers due to its compatibility with food waste.
* Closed-loop recycling to monomers (CRM) can be seen as ultimate chemical recycling in that it ensures the recovery of a given polymer's building blocks.

* Think systemically, suspend trade of low-quality plastic waste from developed countries to developing countries and introduce taxes on fossil resources can boost the circular economy of plastics.
* Developing a system in which plastics are designed for both chemical recycling and biodegradation.  
* No silver-bullet solution exists for the multifaceted nature of plastic pollution.
