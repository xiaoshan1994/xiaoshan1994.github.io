## 1. The composition of increasing plastic demand during the covid-19
[](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364032120301763-gr3_lrg.jpg)
The plastic demand in the medical sector to help in combating the COVID-19 including the face shield (PP), gown (LDPE), vinyl gloves (PVC), disposable bag, tube, masks (plastic sheet and non-woven fabric) etc. (from WHO)

> Changes on the waste amount and composition trigger a structure change in **waste management system**

The relationship between MSW and plastics waste: treatment capacity change, waste change(decreased solid waste, increased packaging from deliveries and hospital)
> The amount of waste threatens to overwhelm existing treatment and disposal facilities, posing the risk of secondary contagion from improper waste management.

## 2. New challenges in waste management
> The source of contaminated waste is not limited to hospitals. Patients with mild symptoms self-isolated at home generate contaminated MSW. This requires a substantial structural change in waste management, from the sorting rules, collection, waste treatment to the safety protocol of the waste collection workers.

* Food containers in Germany, which would normally be classified as recyclable waste, now have to be treated as hazardous waste if there is a risk of contamination with pathogens.

* These precautions stimulates the use of plastic, the generation of mixed waste, and the logistic challenges for waste management systems.

>Incineration and steam sterilisation (90 min, 120 °C) are the common pathways for thermal treatment of hazardous medical waste.

> The main challenge is that COVID-19 is creating a waste surge that can exceed treatment capacity by a large margin. Whether to utilise the MSW incineration capacity for medical waste in this critical situation remains an open question. **In Spain, it is stated that if necessary, cement plants can co-incinerate waste upon request [24].** **Norway allows a temporary change in landfill permits and permits to carry waste elsewhere to cope with the medical waste surge [24], if necessary.**

## 3. Scenarios for the future
* Disaster waste management: treatment approaches, infrastructure, capacity (scalability), mobilised/automated (e.g. remote-controlled robots) treatment and collection design, logistics, safety, and regulatory aspects link to the bio disaster response.
* Incorporation of social factors and uncertainties
* Better trade-offs between medical/healthcare plastics and regular single-use plastics

# The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Problem of Plastic Waste in the EU

New challenges brought by Covid-19:
1. Extra pressure Leads to inappropriate management strategies, including mobile incineration, direct landfills, and local burnings;
2. Recycling industry was brought to a temporary halt by lockdowns
3. A surge of single-use plastic products (mostly non-recyclable), followed by a growth of municipal solid waste.

## 1. Implications of COVID – 19 on plastic waste generation.

* Food package waste;
* Personal protective equipment (disposable PPE, to protect against the risk of virus transmission);
* Medical packaging waste from both hospitals and households;
* Single-use plastic bags (a shift from re-useable bags due to hygienic superiority);
* Panic buying and online grocery shopping (unnecessary stockpiling);
* Consumer behavioural changes (due to paranoia of viral transmission)

## 2. Challenges for the current waste management systems

> The most extensively used techniques of plastic waste management across the globe are {{< hl-text blue>}}mechanical recycling{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}incineration{{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}landfilling{{< /hl-text >}}.

> Ellen McArthur Foundation estimates the global {{< hl-text blue>}}mechanical recycling rates{{< /hl-text >}} of waste plastics at {{< hl-text blue>}}16%{{< /hl-text >}}. In comparison, the remaining waste plastics were either {{< hl-text blue>}}incinerated (25%){{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}sanitary/unsanitary landfilled (40%){{< /hl-text >}}, or gets leaked into the environment due to {{< hl-text blue>}}mismanagement (19%){{< /hl-text >}} as shown in Fig. 3 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).

{{< alert info >}}Depicting a clear picture!{{< /alert >}}

> {{< hl-text blue>}}Polymer cross-contamination{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}presence of additives{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}inorganic impurities{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}irregular or inadequate segregation at source or during collection{{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}partial polymer degradation{{< /hl-text >}} have always been the major constraints for mechanical recycling of waste plastics (Hopewell et al., 2009).

> Multi-layered plastics that have {{< hl-text blue>}}low reward to effort ratio{{< /hl-text >}} in their {{< hl-text blue>}}collection{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}high pre-processing costs{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}technological constraints{{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}weak integral structure{{< /hl-text >}} (UNEP, 2018)

> Moreover, {{< hl-text blue>}}the plummeting of oil prices{{< /hl-text >}} during COVID-19 caused a dramatic decrease in the value of virgin plastics affecting the {{< hl-text blue>}}competitiveness of recycled plastics{{< /hl-text >}} in the market (Bell, 2016; Walker, 2020).

> Furthermore, {{< hl-text blue>}}shortage of staff{{< /hl-text >}} due to the fear of viral transmission during the collection and handling of waste plastics and {{< hl-text blue>}}restricted transportation{{< /hl-text >}} have crashed the plastic recycling industry (B.I.R, 2020).

> Incineration is popular in {{< hl-text blue>}}northern Europe{{< /hl-text >}} for handling MSW (including plastic waste) for its ability to recover energy complementing the energy needs of the market. Some of the developed nations like Sweden, Denmark, and Poland have adopted advanced and improved technology for {{< hl-text blue>}}air pollution control{{< /hl-text >}} in their {{< hl-text blue>}}‘waste to energy’ technology{{< /hl-text >}} for treating waste (Malinauskaite et al., 2017).

{{< alert info >}}As plastic waste is contained in MSW, whether we should try per unit environmental impact of treating MSW in LCI rather than using only disposal of plastics?{{< /alert >}}

>Sweden is a very good example in terms of energy output (23%) recovery from both municipal and industrial waste incineration (Ericsson and Werner, 2016).

{{< alert info >}}Go back to the system boundary of LCA of China's ban, should the process of energy recovery by incineration be considered? {{< /alert >}}
