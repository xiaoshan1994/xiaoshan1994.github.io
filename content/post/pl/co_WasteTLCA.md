# Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emission plastics by a circular carbon economy

## Scenarios
Using this model, we project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* The recycling pathway allows **maximal recycling** of all plastic wastes, on the basis of a 6% minimal **landfilling** rate projected by Geyer et al.
* Biomass and CCU pathways assume that plastic waste is primarily incinerated.
The resulting CO2 emissions are circulated via biomass uptake or CCU.
* The circular carbon pathway optimally combines recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU.
* The GHG emissions of all circular pathways are benchmarked to state-of-the-art plastic production and waste incineration, framed as the linear carbon pathway.
## End-of-life technologies
Three options exist to treat plastic waste: landfilling, incineration (e.g., energy recovery), and recycling. Several intermediate waste fractions occur during these three waste treatment options: sorted fractions, residues from sorting, and residues from mechanical and chemical recycling (Fig.
S2).
Landfilling and incineration are included for all plastic wastes and intermediate waste fractions. In case of mechanical recycling, current practice from European countries like Germany and Austria shows that plastic packaging waste can be efficiently recycled. In contrast, other plastic wastes suffer significant difficulties due to impurities inside the waste and cannot be adequately recycled mechanically (39). Thus, our analysis only considers mechanical recycling for sorted fractions of plastic packaging waste.

In addition to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling is highlighted as one of the most promising technologies to combat the plastic crisis and, at the same time, reduce greenhouse gas emissions of chemical and plastic production. While chemical recycling is not limited to the plastic waste input, its outputs range from refinery feedstock over liquid and gaseous fuels to monomer products and even value-added chemicals. Previous studies showed that chemical recycling is most promising if value-added chemicals, like monomers, are produced (42, 78). However, these technologies are still under development. Thus, this publication includes the **pyrolysis of plastic wastes to steam-cracking feedstock**, e.g., naphtha, and the production of the respective chemical monomers from chemical recycling as early-stage technologies. Chemical recycling is assumed to be able to treat every plastic waste and all intermediate waste fractions.

## CCU pathway
**The CCU pathway establishes carbon loops via the incineration of plastic and the respective re-utilization of CO2.** The following high-TRL technologies are available: methanol and methane from CO2, direct air capture, and electrified steam production. Via methanol-to-olefins or methanol-to-aromatics, all plastic raw materials can be produced. The following low-TRL technologies are available: benzene, toluene, p-xylene, mixed xylenes, carbon monoxide, ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene, and styrene from CO2, as well as the ohmic heating to provide high-temperature thermal energy.

## Abstract
* This study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste (MPW) via pyrolysis with the established waste management alternatives: mechanical recycling and energy recovery.
* Three LCA studies have been carried out under three perspectives: waste, product and a combination of the two.
* To ensure robust comparisons, the impacts have been estimated using two impact assessment methods: Environmental footprint and ReCiPe.
* The results suggest that chemical recycling via pyrolysis has a 50% lower climate change impact and life cycle energy use than the energy recovery option. The climate change impact and energy use of pyrolysis and mechanical recycling of MPW are similar if the quality of the recyclate is taken into account.
* Furthermore, MPW recycled by pyrolysis has a significantly lower climate change impact (−0.45 vs 1.89 t CO2 eq./t plastic) than the equivalent made from virgin fossil resources.
* However, pyrolysis has significantly higher other impacts than mechanical recycling, energy recovery and production of virgin plastics.
* Sensitivity analyses show that some assumptions have notable effects on the results, including the assumed geographical region and its energy mix, carbon conversion efficiency of pyrolysis and recyclate quality.

## Methods, results, and discussions
1. Waste perspective
* The functional unit is defined as the treatment of 1 t of MPW (mixed plastic waste).
* Scope: collection and transportation of MPW from households, sorting and pyrolysis of MPW to produce pyrolysis oil, as the main product and char as a co-product.
* System boundaries:

* In Germany, 30% of MPW is incinerated with MSW and 70% is used to produce RDF and recover energy (UBA, 2018).

The credits are related to the avoided production of naphtha displaced by the pyrolysis oil, which reduces the total impact by 423 kg CO2 eq./t.

[^fuels]: it is assumed that all electricity is generated from lignite (LHV: 9.9 MJ/kg) and all heat from light fuel oil (LHV: 42.8 MJ/kg). This scenario might be representative of parts of Eastern Europe. In the renewables option (S-1.2), electricity from hydro power (100%) and heat from biogas (50%) and biomass (50%) are considered as examples. This or similar scenario could be relevant in the future for some European countries (e.g. Scandinavian).
