# Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emission plastics by a circular carbon economy

## Scenarios
Using this model, we project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* The recycling pathway allows **maximal recycling** of all plastic wastes, on the basis of a 6% minimal **landfilling** rate projected by Geyer et al.
* Biomass and CCU pathways assume that plastic waste is primarily incinerated.
The resulting CO2 emissions are circulated via biomass uptake or CCU.
* The circular carbon pathway optimally combines recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU.
* The GHG emissions of all circular pathways are benchmarked to state-of-the-art plastic production and waste incineration, framed as the linear carbon pathway.
## End-of-life technologies
Three options exist to treat plastic waste: landfilling, incineration (e.g., energy recovery), and recycling. Several intermediate waste fractions occur during these three waste treatment options: sorted fractions, residues from sorting, and residues from mechanical and chemical recycling (Fig.
S2).
Landfilling and incineration are included for all plastic wastes and intermediate waste fractions. In case of mechanical recycling, current practice from European countries like Germany and Austria shows that plastic packaging waste can be efficiently recycled. In contrast, other plastic wastes suffer significant difficulties due to impurities inside the waste and cannot be adequately recycled mechanically (39). Thus, our analysis only considers mechanical recycling for sorted fractions of plastic packaging waste.

In addition to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling is highlighted as one of the most promising technologies to combat the plastic crisis and, at the same time, reduce greenhouse gas emissions of chemical and plastic production. While chemical recycling is not limited to the plastic waste input, its outputs range from refinery feedstock over liquid and gaseous fuels to monomer products and even value-added chemicals. Previous studies showed that chemical recycling is most promising if value-added chemicals, like monomers, are produced (42, 78). However, these technologies are still under development. Thus, this publication includes the **pyrolysis of plastic wastes to steam-cracking feedstock**, e.g., naphtha, and the production of the respective chemical monomers from chemical recycling as early-stage technologies. Chemical recycling is assumed to be able to treat every plastic waste and all intermediate waste fractions.

## CCU pathway
**The CCU pathway establishes carbon loops via the incineration of plastic and the respective re-utilization of CO2.** The following high-TRL technologies are available: methanol and methane from CO2, direct air capture, and electrified steam production. Via methanol-to-olefins or methanol-to-aromatics, all plastic raw materials can be produced. The following low-TRL technologies are available: benzene, toluene, p-xylene, mixed xylenes, carbon monoxide, ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene, and styrene from CO2, as well as the ohmic heating to provide high-temperature thermal energy.

## Abstract
* This study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste (MPW) via pyrolysis with the established waste management alternatives: mechanical recycling and energy recovery.
* Three LCA studies have been carried out under three perspectives: waste, product and a combination of the two.
* To ensure robust comparisons, the impacts have been estimated using two impact assessment methods: Environmental footprint and ReCiPe.
* The results suggest that chemical recycling via pyrolysis has a 50% lower climate change impact and life cycle energy use than the energy recovery option. The climate change impact and energy use of pyrolysis and mechanical recycling of MPW are similar if the quality of the recyclate is taken into account.
* Furthermore, MPW recycled by pyrolysis has a significantly lower climate change impact (−0.45 vs 1.89 t CO2 eq./t plastic) than the equivalent made from virgin fossil resources.
* However, pyrolysis has significantly higher other impacts than mechanical recycling, energy recovery and production of virgin plastics.
* Sensitivity analyses show that some assumptions have notable effects on the results, including the assumed geographical region and its energy mix, carbon conversion efficiency of pyrolysis and recyclate quality.

## Methods, results, and discussions
1. Waste perspective
* The functional unit is defined as the treatment of 1 t of MPW (mixed plastic waste).
* Scope: collection and transportation of MPW from households, sorting and pyrolysis of MPW to produce pyrolysis oil, as the main product and char as a co-product.
* System boundaries:

## Introduction
* Still, only {{< hl-text blue>}}9%{{< /hl-text >}} of the plastics ever produced have been recycled. The other fractions of waste plastic are either incinerated (12%), landfilled or lost to the environment (79%) (Geyer et al., 2017).
* Plastic packaging from municipal waste is most recycled, whereas plastic recycling from other sectors (Construction, electronics, automotive) lags behind (Consultic, 2012).
* The recycling outputs are credited as ‘avoided impact’ (materials, feedstock or energy).
## Methodology
* Environmental data on materials, fuels and emissions was obtained from the ecoinvent 3.4 cut-off by classification database.
* SimaPro 8
* applying the midpoint impact categories from ReCiPe 2008 (h)
* the total impact was calculated to a single score by applying {{< hl-text blue>}}shadow prices{{< /hl-text >}} on the ReCiPe characterized results. The shadow price set used is developed by CE Delft and TNO and gives the most recent economic damage per impact category (De Bruyn et al., 2010, Ligthart and van Harmelen, 2019).

2.3. Recycling technologies
* The level of development of the recycling technologies is defined on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale (Mankins, 1995). Three levels: low (1–4), medium (5–7), and high (8–9).

1. Primary recycling or closed-loop recycling (TRL: high).
Recycled products have the same properties as the previous product.
  - mechanical recycling for pure plastics (TRL: high, not mixed with others).
  - Dissolution of polymers with two solvents (TRL: low).

2. Secondary recycling or open-loop recycling.
Recyclate is of lower quality than the original material.
  - Open-loop mechanical recycling (TRL: high). Collected in mixed waste streams
    and contains a significant amount of contamination.

3. Tertiary recycling includes plastic to feedstock and plastic to monomer recycling[^TR].
  - (1) Gasification to feedstock products (TRL: high)[^gas].
  - (2) Pyrolysis to feedstock products (TRL: high)[^pyr].
  - (3) Pyrolysis to wax products (TRL: high)[^wax].
  - (4) Thermochemical recycling to monomers through gasification (TRL: medium)[^Ther].
  - (5) Thermochemical recycling to monomers through pyrolysis (TRL: medium)[^THERPYR].
  - (6) Depolymerization through glycolysis (醣酵解) (TRL: medium)[^DEPO].
  - (7) Hydrolysis with water for specific biopolymers (TRL: low)[^HYDROW].

4. Quaternary recycling or incineration of plastic material with energy recovery[^qr].

* The system boundaries for the LCA matrix model include: polymer granulate production, recycling treatment impacts and avoided products.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Outside the system boundaries are all parameters that vary greatly depending on product type, sector, and waste collection method.{{< /hl-text >}} Polymer processing steps to products (e.g. injection moulding), the addition of additive materials, and waste collection and pre-treatment (sorting, cleaning) are not included.

## Methods
* The household waste can be categorised into two main types: recyclables and residual.
* Residual waste is collected weekly at the kerbside and transported to the Cornwall {{< hl-text blue>}}Energy Recovery Centre (CERC){{< /hl-text >}}, the only {{< hl-text blue>}}waste-to-energy facility{{< /hl-text >}} in Cornwall that started operation in 2017 (Cornwall Council, 2018a).
* Recyclables are separated by the residents and placed in four different containers. The recyclables are collected every fortnight at the kerbside and transported to one of the two {{< hl-text blue>}}Material Recovery Facilities (MRF){{< /hl-text >}} situated in the towns of Bodmin and Pool.
* At the MRFs, the plastic bottles (including the PET bottles) are consolidated, and transported by lorry out of the county to one of the three {{< hl-text blue>}}reprocessing facilities{{< /hl-text >}}.
* 2017–18 total household waste ->
two parts: residual waste and waste intended for recycling ->
percentage of plastic bottles in every part ->
percentage of plastic bottles made of PET
(same way for glass bottles)
* Functional unit: the liquids packaging service provided by 2468 t of PET bottles to households in Cornwall.
* the users can specify the glass/PET mass ratio for the bottling of the {{< hl-text blue>}}same quantity of liquid content{{< /hl-text >}}.

* For the production of PET bottles, the raw material is assumed to be {{< hl-text blue>}}35%{{< /hl-text >}} of recycled bottle grade PET granulates and {{< hl-text blue>}}65%{{< /hl-text >}} of virgin PET granulates (Shen et al., 2011).

## 2.3. Life Cycle Inventory

### 2.3.1. Production
1. {{< hl-text orange>}}polyethylene terephthalate production, granulate, amorphous{{< /hl-text >}}
Technology:  PET production out of PTA (purified terephthalic acid) and ethylene glycol.
2. {{< hl-text orange>}}polyethylene terephthalate production, granulate, bottle grade, recycled (CH){{< /hl-text >}}
  - Processes deliver the byproduct waste polethylene, unsorted, for recycling[^pro]. There are two recycled PET grades produced in Switzerland[^twore].
3. {{< hl-text orange>}}Stretch blow molding{{< /hl-text >}}[^sbm].

### 2.3.3. End-of-life
{{< hl-text orange>}}The ‘net scrap’ avoided burden approach {{< /hl-text >}}
For the PET bottles, the avoided virgin PET production would be the percentage that is sent for recycling (53%) minus the losses during the recycling processes (25% × 53% = 13% of the initial PET bottles) and the percentage of the recycled content that was used for the production of the initial PET bottles (35%), equal to 5% of the initial PET bottles.
{{< alert info>}}avoided burden of plastics = recyclables - losses - recyclables contained in the products {{< /alert >}}



[^fuels]: it is assumed that all electricity is generated from lignite (LHV: 9.9 MJ/kg) and all heat from light fuel oil (LHV: 42.8 MJ/kg). This scenario might be representative of parts of Eastern Europe. In the renewables option (S-1.2), electricity from hydro power (100%) and heat from biogas (50%) and biomass (50%) are considered as examples. This or similar scenario could be relevant in the future for some European countries (e.g. Scandinavian).
[^gas]: This chemical recycling technology resembles {{< hl-text blue>}}a high temperature gasification{{< /hl-text >}}. For this technology the polymer is used as a {{< hl-text blue>}}refuse derived fuel{{< /hl-text >}} and is transformed in a gasifier to syngas with a {{< hl-text blue>}}H2/CO molar ratio of 2:1{{< /hl-text >}}. The quantity of syngas and the accompanying CO2 emissions depending on the polymer type.
[^pyr]: For this chemical recycling technology the polymer is used as a {{< hl-text blue>}}refuse derived fuel{{< /hl-text >}} and is converted to pyrolysis oil, assumed equivalent to diesel. The energy content of the diesel depends on the {{< hl-text blue>}}polymer calorific value{{< /hl-text >}}.
[^wax]: For this chemical recycling technology, the polymer is used to obtain {{< hl-text blue>}}medium length hydrocarbon (碳氢化合物,烃) chains (C10-C14){{< /hl-text >}} to replace {{< hl-text blue>}}paraffin{{< /hl-text >}} like waxes, which can potentially be used to replace {{< hl-text blue>}}lubricating oils{{< /hl-text >}} as well.
[^Ther]: The polymers are gasified at a medium to high temperature and {{< hl-text blue>}}a gas with a mix of chemicals{{< /hl-text >}} are obtained, including BTX (a mixture of benzene, toluene and xylenes), monomers and short carbon molecules (C2-C5). {{< hl-text blue>}}The output can be used to make new polymers{{< /hl-text >}}. The chemicals formed strongly depends on the polymer. An important requirement for monomer recovery is **{{< hl-text blue>}}product separation{{< /hl-text >}}**.
[^THERPYR]: The polymer is pyrolyzed on a medium temperature and {{< hl-text blue>}}an oil with a mix of chemicals{{< /hl-text >}} is obtained, which include monomers, BTX (a mixture of benzene, toluene and xylenes) and shorter carbon molecules. These can potentially be re-used for making new polymers and the chemicals formed strongly depends on the polymer. An important requirement for monomer recovery is {{< hl-text blue>}}separation of the remaining oil{{< /hl-text >}}.
[^DEPO]: /'diː,pɒlɪməraɪ'zeɪʃən/ With this chemical recycling technology, {{< hl-text blue>}}ethylene glycol{{< /hl-text >}} is added to specific polymers (PET, Nylon 6) in the presence of a {{< hl-text blue>}}catalyst{{< /hl-text >}}, the polymer is depolymerized to its building blocks, which can be re-used in making new polymers.
[^HYDROW]: For specific biopolymers (in this case, PLA), the polymer can be dissolved in water when heated up and broken down to its monomer building blocks. These monomers can be re-used in making new polymers.
[^TR]: The polymer is not kept intact, but valuable materials (feedstock, monomers) are being recovered.
[^qr]:  The material is incinerated and fully destroyed. However, the high calorific value of plastic results in recovery of energy as {{< hl-text blue>}}heat and electricity{{< /hl-text >}}. The amount of heat and power depend on the {{< hl-text blue>}}calorific value (energy content){{< /hl-text >}} of the polymer and the {{< hl-text blue>}}configuration of the waste-to-energy plant{{< /hl-text >}}.
[^pro]: 1. sorting (receive pure-coloured PET bales in recycling plants in Switzerland);
2. cut the wire of PET bales;
3. pass through a metal separator (separates aluminium-containing labels);
4. shredded with knives to 12 mm size in the mill;
5. air separator separates the label residues from the PET flakes (labels to incinerator);
6. Sink in water where caps separated (caps for PE recycling);
7. flakes purified by heating at 200 degree with 50% sodium hydroxide;
8. washing and drying.
[^twore]: amorphous (no definite shape) and bottle grade. For bottle grade, the viscosity of the recycled flakes is increased to a comparable level of primary PET by solid state polymerization (SSP). Data were derived from involved recycling facilities). About 40’000 t of PET bottles per year are collected in Switzerland and further processed to bottle grade (30 % recycling content) or amorphous (50 % recycling content) PET granulate. 20 % of the PET cannot be recycled again and is incinerated. Data for the PET recycling processes were derived via PET Recycling Schweiz (PRS).
[^sbm]: a manufacturing process that's well suited for different applications across a broad range of industry sectors. Blow molding is an engineering procedure in which hollow plastic forms such as water bottles and juice bottles are formed.
