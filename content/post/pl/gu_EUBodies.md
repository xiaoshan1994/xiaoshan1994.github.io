There are 4 main decision-making institutions which lead the EU’s administration. These institutions collectively provide the EU with policy direction and play different roles in the law-making process:
the European Parliament (Brussels/Strasbourg/Luxembourg)
the European Council (Brussels)
the Council of the European Union (Brussels/Luxembourg)
the European Commission (Brussels/Luxembourg/Representations across the EU)

# European Parliament
{{< hl-text blue>}}Represents the citizens of EU countries and is directly elected by them.{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text blue>}}It takes decisions on European laws jointly{{< /hl-text >}} with the Council of the European Union. {{< hl-text blue>}}It also approves the EU budget{{< /hl-text >}}. It runs a network of liaison offices in EU capitals, London, Edinburgh and Washington D.C.

# European Council
The heads of state or government of the EU countries meet, as the European Council, to define the general political direction and priorities of the European Union. The European Council is chaired by a president who is elected for a 2.5-year term, renewable once. It does not adopt laws except for possible EU Treaty amendments.

# Council of the European Union
{{< hl-text blue>}}Represents the governments of EU countries.{{< /hl-text >}} The Council of the EU {{< hl-text blue>}}is where national ministers from each government meet to adopt laws and coordinate policies.{{< /hl-text >}} Ministers meet in different configurations depending on the topic to be discussed. The Council of the EU takes decisions on European laws jointly with the European Parliament.

# European Commission
Represents the common interests of the EU and {{< hl-text blue>}}is the EU’s main executive body.{{< /hl-text >}} It uses its ‘right of initiative’ to put forward proposals for new laws, which are scrutinised and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. It also manages EU policies (except for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is conducted by the High Representative for CFSP, Vice-President of the European Commission), and the EU’s budget and ensures that countries apply EU law correctly. Representation offices act as the Commission’s voice across the EU. They monitor and analyse public opinion in their host country, provide information about EU policies and the way the EU works, and facilitate the Commission’s cooperation with the host member country.

The work of these 4 main EU institutions, which covers the legislative and executive tasks of the EU, is complemented by the work of another 3 EU institutions: the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. These 3 institutions are responsible for managing the judicial, financial and external audit aspects of the European Union.
