# UK plastic waste being dumped and burned in Turkey, says Greenpeace
[BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57139474?_ga=2.64868781.303243932.1643832699-289407696.1643832699)
**17 May 2021**
* Greenpeace said about 40% of the UK's plastic waste exports were sent to Turkey last year.
* But rather than being recycled, investigators saw some of it dumped by roads, in fields and in waterways.
* Greenpeace's report warned Turkey was becoming Europe's "largest plastic waste dump".
* {{< hl-text orange>}}The {{< hl-text blue>}}UK{{< /hl-text >}} generates more plastic waste per person than any other country apart from the US{{< /hl-text >}}, the report added.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Turkey, Malaysia and Poland{{< /hl-text >}} received the largest amounts of plastic waste exports from the UK in 2020.
# Why some countries are shipping back plastic waste?
[BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48444874)
Published June 2019
* Many wealthy countries send their recyclable waste overseas because it's cheap, helps meet recycling targets and reduces domestic landfill.
* For developing countries taking in the rubbish, it's a valuable source of income.
* But contaminated plastic and rubbish that cannot be recycled often gets mixed in and ends up in illegal processing centres.
* Materials that can't be recycled end up being burned illegally, dumped in landfills or waterways, creating risks to the environment and public health.
* Due to China's ban, global plastic waste exports dipped by almost half by the end of 2018, compared with 2016 levels. Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey, India and Poland all took up the slack.
* Malaysia took a major share - the plastic waste it imported from 10 countries in just the first six months of 2018 was nearly as much as the total it received in 2016 and 2017.
* Malaysia has revoked import permits and has been clamping down on illegal processing plants.
* The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia) says after a clear dip, "imports have begun rising again in the {{< hl-text blue>}}last quarter of 2018{{< /hl-text >}}, suggesting challenges in enforcing respective country bans".
# Why plastic recycling is so confusing
18 December 2018
[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45496884)
* All four nations of UK have set their recycling rate targets (Scotland 70%  by 2025, as does Wales. Northern Ireland 60% municipal waste by 2020.)

* BBC analysis shows there are 39 different sets of rules for what can be put in plastic recycling collections: Most collect bottles; Others collect pots, tubs and trays; Some collect a much wider range.

* Waste plastic is collected in different ways too: Some local authorities collect all their recycling in one bin; Others ask households to separate their plastics from the rest of their recycling; Councils also employ many different companies to collect and sort their plastics.
* And having different recycling schemes in different areas - for example, in some areas you can recycle margarine tubs and in other areas you cannot - makes labelling difficult.
* How is the government proposing to tackle plastic recycling?
1. Tackle the current postcode recycling lottery under which different materials are recyclable in different areas
2. Introduce consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what they can recycle
3. Make the firms that produce materials responsible for the cost of disposing of those items
4. Encourage manufacturers to design products that last longer and increase the levels of repair and re-use
5. Crack down on waste crime by introducing electronic tracking of waste shipments
6. Introduce a tax on plastic packaging made of less than 30% recycled plastic
7. Ban plastic packaging where an alternative material could be used
8. Improve the quality of plastic being exported
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Plastic can often become too contaminated for recycling and have to be sent to landfill or incinerated instead.{{< /hl-text >}} This happens for several reasons:
1. People are confused about what goes in which bin.
2. People are not always very careful about what they put in.
3. {{< hl-text orange>}}The plastic is contaminated with food waste.{{< /hl-text >}}
4. {{< hl-text orange>}}In areas where all recycling is collected in one bin, one type of waste can contaminate another.{{< /hl-text >}}

1. {{< hl-text blue>}}Bottles{{< /hl-text >}} are mainly made of {{< hl-text blue>}}PET{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}HDPE{{< /hl-text >}} and these are easy to collect and recycle.
2. Most {{< hl-text blue>}}trays{{< /hl-text >}} are made from {{< hl-text blue>}}polypropylene (PP){{< /hl-text >}} and this is pretty easy to recycle too but not all councils have access to the right facilities
3. {{< hl-text blue>}}LDPE{{< /hl-text >}}, used to make some {{< hl-text blue>}}carrier bags{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}cling film{{< /hl-text >}}, is easy to process but more difficult to sort and can often be contaminated with food.
4. {{< hl-text blue>}}Polystyrene (PS){{< /hl-text >}}, used to make some {{< hl-text blue>}}yoghurt pots{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}plastic cutlery{{< /hl-text >}}, is not widely recycled.
5. {{< hl-text blue>}}PVC{{< /hl-text >}} makes up small amount of packaging but can contaminate other plastic recycling.
6. {{< hl-text blue>}}Biscuit wrappers{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}meat trays{{< /hl-text >}} can be made from a mixture of many different types of plastic, making them the most difficult type of packaging to recycle.





# What are microplastics?

* Microplastics are solid plastic particles composed of polymers and functional additives less than 5 millimetres in size.
* Already, microplastics have been found in almost all marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems as well as in food and drinking water.
* Current bans mainly focus on the application of scrubbing microbeads in cosmetics. These beads are rinsed off after use and migrate to sewage treatment plants and surface waters.

# Bioplastics--alternatives to fossil-based plastics
* Recently, a stronger EU regulatory focus on the different stages of the plastic lifecycle and a growing public scrutiny regarding plastic waste.
* Current regulations covering plastics are not consistent or suited to the specifics of bioplastics.

*  Each year, at least 8 million tonnes of plastics leak into the ocean â€“
which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute.
* Scale up the adoption of {{< hl-text blue>}}industrially compostable plastic packaging{{< /hl-text >}} for targeted applications such as garbage bags for organic waste and food packaging for events.
* Drastically reduce the leakage of plastics into natural systems and other negative externalities.
* The plastics industry as a whole is highly reliant on finite stocks of {{< hl-text blue>}}oil{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}gas{{< /hl-text >}}, which make up more than 90% of its feedstock.

* The {{< hl-text blue>}}externalities{{< /hl-text >}} related to the use of plastics and plastic packaging are concentrated in three areas: {{< hl-text orange>}}degradation of natural systems as a result of {{< hl-text blue>}}leakage{{< /hl-text >}}, especially in the ocean;{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}GHG resulting from {{< hl-text blue>}}production{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}after-use incineration{{< /hl-text >}};{{< /hl-text >}} and health and environmental impacts from substances of concern.

*  An LCA optimisation by each individual actor does not necessarily lead to better system outcomes (while it is well suited to evaluate individual choices today, it is less suitable for determining the target state towards which a system as a whole could innovate).
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Another drawback is considering only carbon, leaving behind the effects of leakage into the natural environment. {{< /hl-text >}}
* Format and delivery model redesign could reduce or eliminate the need for small-format plastic packaging items (e.g. for former one, tear-off tabs to stay-on tabs, flip-top cap of ketchup; for latter one, a dispenser instead of sachets or 'disappearing package' (water-soluble laundry detergent pods))
