# About Plastic Soup Foundation
Founded in February 2011, we are a single-issue organization and focus entirely on plastics. With a team of about twenty people, we give everything to achieve our goal: no plastic in our water or our bodies!

We are based in Amsterdam but have an international focus. Our mission has not only been embraced in the Netherlands but also particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and India.

# BAN THE EXPORT OF PLASTIC WASTE!
16 February 2021
* The usable items are recycled there and the rest, estimated to be around {{< hl-text blue>}}30%{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text orange>}}is incinerated or illegally dumped{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The signatory countries of Treaty of Basel agreed additional rules that only clean plastic waste that can be recycled immediately may be traded freely across the world.
* However, the Pointer broadcast shows that the system has a lot of loopholes: 1. containers do not always contain what is stated; 2. recipient recycling companies have the appropriate permits.
* In the Netherlands, recycling companies need to pay for the plastic that is too dirty or hard to separate (will be incinerated), which drives them selling abroad.
* The chance of being caught in the port of Antwerp is small as the trick is to use another customs code.
* Exports within the EU need to meet more stringent regulations so that no more illegal plastic waste is dumped in countries such as {{< hl-text blue>}}Poland{{< /hl-text >}} anymore.
