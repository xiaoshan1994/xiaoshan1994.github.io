# Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emission plastics by a circular carbon economy

## Scenarios
Using this model, we project five pathways for life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic from “cradle-to-grave” in the year 2050.
* The recycling pathway allows **maximal recycling** of all plastic wastes, on the basis of a 6% minimal **landfilling** rate projected by Geyer et al.
* Biomass and CCU pathways assume that plastic waste is primarily incinerated.
The resulting CO2 emissions are circulated via biomass uptake or CCU.
* The circular carbon pathway optimally combines recycling, biomass utilization, and CCU.
* The GHG emissions of all circular pathways are benchmarked to state-of-the-art plastic production and waste incineration, framed as the linear carbon pathway.
## End-of-life technologies
Three options exist to treat plastic waste: landfilling, incineration (e.g., energy recovery), and recycling. Several intermediate waste fractions occur during these three waste treatment options: sorted fractions, residues from sorting, and residues from mechanical and chemical recycling (Fig.
S2).
Landfilling and incineration are included for all plastic wastes and intermediate waste fractions. In case of mechanical recycling, current practice from European countries like Germany and Austria shows that plastic packaging waste can be efficiently recycled. In contrast, other plastic wastes suffer significant difficulties due to impurities inside the waste and cannot be adequately recycled mechanically (39). Thus, our analysis only considers mechanical recycling for sorted fractions of plastic packaging waste.

In addition to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling is highlighted as one of the most promising technologies to combat the plastic crisis and, at the same time, reduce greenhouse gas emissions of chemical and plastic production. While chemical recycling is not limited to the plastic waste input, its outputs range from refinery feedstock over liquid and gaseous fuels to monomer products and even value-added chemicals. Previous studies showed that chemical recycling is most promising if value-added chemicals, like monomers, are produced (42, 78). However, these technologies are still under development. Thus, this publication includes the **pyrolysis of plastic wastes to steam-cracking feedstock**, e.g., naphtha, and the production of the respective chemical monomers from chemical recycling as early-stage technologies. Chemical recycling is assumed to be able to treat every plastic waste and all intermediate waste fractions.

CCU pathway
The CCU pathway establishes carbon loops via the incineration of plastic and the respective re-utilization of CO2. The following high-TRL technologies are available: methanol and methane from CO2, direct air capture, and electrified steam production. Via methanol-to-olefins or methanol-to-aromatics, all plastic raw materials can be produced. The following low-TRL technologies are available: benzene, toluene, p-xylene, mixed xylenes, carbon monoxide, ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene, and styrene from CO2, as well as the ohmic heating to provide high-temperature thermal energy.
