# Abstract

The first contemporary plastics material flow by **resin type** through the US economy (2017 production, sales, use markets and end-of-life management).  

# 2. Methods

## 2.1. Plastics manufacture, trade and use by market sectors

* The starting point is the survey-based industry data compiled for the American Chemistry Council (ACC), covering 95% - 100% of the total US production for the materials reported.
* Reported exports represent sales by resin manufacturers to foreign buyers, but do not capture additional exports by brokers or other third party sales.
* We include US imports of {{< hl-text blue>}}primary form plastics{{< /hl-text >}} as well as {{< hl-text blue>}}formed plastics (rods, sticks, sheets, films, plates, caps, etc){{< /hl-text >}} based on {{< hl-text blue>}}US trade data for 2017{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The plastics contained in {{< hl-text blue>}}imported finished goods (foods, apparel, footwear, computers and electronics, appliances, automobiles, furniture, medical supplies, athletic goods, toys) and their packaging{{< /hl-text >}} were estimated using the {{< hl-text blue>}}monetary value of net imports into the US{{< /hl-text >}}, averaged over three years (2016â€“2018) combined with sector-level estimates of {{< hl-text blue>}}plastic content per unit of revenue {{< /hl-text >}}.
