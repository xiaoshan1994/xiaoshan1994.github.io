# 1. Model framework
The overall model framework is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. It is comprised of a building demand module, a material demand module, and a material supply module. Each module is described in turn.

Supplementary Figure 1. The conceptual framework of the GloBUME model. This dynamic GloBUME model (global dynamic building materials use and embodied GHG emissions model) consists of three layers, i.e. a building demand layer, a material demand layer, and a material supply layer. Two rectangles
in the center represent stocks of floor area and materials respectively, ovals denote flows, hexagons are
the drivers or determinants. Colors indicate drivers given by each scenario, driven by related strategies
illustrated in the rounded rectangles filled with the same colors. Data and codes details are freely
available from the link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171943.

## Building demand layer
In the building demand layer, the dynamic building stock and flows are calculated by the following equations:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141764065-3ea2a76a-734a-4be0-9e4b-f61a2441b28c.png)

Equation (1) describes the fundamental balance between stocks and flows of building floor area, where A(𝑡) denotes the building demand in year 𝑡, and is the key driver of the model, determined by population, denoted by 𝑃(𝑡), and floor area per capita, denoted by A𝑝(𝑡), as shown in Equation (2) and Supplementary Figure 1. A𝑖𝑛(𝑡) represents the building inflow in year t and is determined by the increase in building demand, calculated by 𝐴(𝑡)− 𝐴(𝑡 −1), and the building outflow, represented by A𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡). {{< hl-text orange>}}The building outflow in year 𝑡, defined as the demolition of buildings which were built in different years before year 𝑡, is determined by the cohort and the building’s lifetime distribution function.{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< alert info>}} Is it possible to involve stock changes caused by climate change factors, flood or other potential factors instead demolition only?{{< /alert >}}

As shown in equation (3), 𝑡′(𝑡′< 𝑡) represents the year in which the building was constructed, and 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′) denotes the probability that the buildings built in year 𝑡′ will be demolished in year 𝑡. We assume buildings’ lifetime follows the {{< hl-text orange>}}Weibull distribution (韦伯分配){{< /hl-text >}}and use the equation (4) to calculate 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′), where 𝜆(𝑡) and 𝑘(𝑡) represent the scale parameter and the shape parameter in year 𝑡 , respectively. Note that the functional form for the lifetime distributions can have a considerable impact on the calculation of outflow and inflow.[^1] {{< hl-text orange>}}Other functional forms{{< /alert >}}, {{< hl-text orange>}}e.g., normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^2], {{< hl-text orange>}}Log-normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^3], {{< hl-text orange>}}and Gamma functions{{< /hl-text >}}[^4] {{< hl-text orange>}}have also used in material related dynamic analysis. However, the Weibull distribution is the most common in the literature, and is therefore the distribution for which the most reliable data are available{{< /hl-text >}}[^5].

This study covers 4 types of residential buildings (detached houses, semi-detached houses, apartments, and high-rise buildings) in 2 areas (urban, and rural) and 4 types of commercial buildings (offices, retails & warehouses, hotels & restaurants, and Other commercial buildings) in 26 global regions. The {{< hl-text blue>}}data on population{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from the integrated assessment model of IMAGE6. The {{< hl-text blue>}}population share by building types{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from Marinova et. al (2019)[^7]. The floor area per capita in each region differs by scenario and is discussed in the Scenario generation section (see below). The region classification is shown in Region classification section (see below).

Note that although we mainly consider social-economic factors (i.e., population and floor area per person) as the driver of the global demand in building stocks. {{< hl-text orange>}}There are other factors that will impact future building stocks and could be modelled in future work (using different modelling approaches). For example, the increasing frequency and severity of climate changes may create extra building demand as a complement for those damaged by natural disasters{{< /hl-text >}}[^8] , {{< hl-text orange}}or abandoned in areas declared uninhabitable{{< /hl-text >}}[^9].
