# 1. Model framework
The overall model framework is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. It is comprised of a building demand module, a material demand module, and a material supply module. Each module is described in turn.

Supplementary Figure 1. The conceptual framework of the GloBUME model. This dynamic GloBUME model (global dynamic building materials use and embodied GHG emissions model) consists of three layers, i.e. a building demand layer, a material demand layer, and a material supply layer. Two rectangles
in the center represent stocks of floor area and materials respectively, ovals denote flows, hexagons are
the drivers or determinants. Colors indicate drivers given by each scenario, driven by related strategies
illustrated in the rounded rectangles filled with the same colors. Data and codes details are freely
available from the link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171943.

## Building demand layer
In the building demand layer, the dynamic building stock and flows are calculated by the following equations:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141764065-3ea2a76a-734a-4be0-9e4b-f61a2441b28c.png)

Equation (1) describes the fundamental balance between stocks and flows of building floor area, where A(𝑡) denotes the building demand in year 𝑡, and is the key driver of the model, determined by population, denoted by 𝑃(𝑡), and floor area per capita, denoted by A𝑝(𝑡), as shown in Equation (2) and Supplementary Figure 1. A𝑖𝑛(𝑡) represents the building inflow in year t and is determined by the increase in building demand, calculated by 𝐴(𝑡)− 𝐴(𝑡 −1), and the building outflow, represented by A𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡). {{< hl-text orange>}}The building outflow in year 𝑡, defined as the demolition of buildings which were built in different years before year 𝑡, is determined by the cohort and the building’s lifetime distribution function.{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< alert info>}} Is it possible to involve stock changes caused by climate change factors, flood or other potential factors instead demolition only?{{< /alert >}}

As shown in equation (3), 𝑡′(𝑡′< 𝑡) represents the year in which the building was constructed, and 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′) denotes the probability that the buildings built in year 𝑡′ will be demolished in year 𝑡. We assume buildings’ lifetime follows the {{< hl-text orange>}}Weibull distribution (韦伯分配){{< /hl-text >}}and use the equation (4) to calculate 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′), where 𝜆(𝑡) and 𝑘(𝑡) represent the scale parameter and the shape parameter in year 𝑡 , respectively. Note that the functional form for the lifetime distributions can have a considerable impact on the calculation of outflow and inflow.[^1] {{< hl-text orange>}}Other functional forms{{< /alert >}}, {{< hl-text orange>}}e.g., normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^2], {{< hl-text orange>}}Log-normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^3], {{< hl-text orange>}}and Gamma functions{{< /hl-text >}}[^4] {{< hl-text orange>}}have also used in material related dynamic analysis. However, the Weibull distribution is the most common in the literature, and is therefore the distribution for which the most reliable data are available{{< /hl-text >}}[^5].

This study covers 4 types of residential buildings (detached houses, semi-detached houses, apartments, and high-rise buildings) in 2 areas (urban, and rural) and 4 types of commercial buildings (offices, retails & warehouses, hotels & restaurants, and Other commercial buildings) in 26 global regions. The {{< hl-text blue>}}data on population{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from the integrated assessment model of IMAGE[^6]. The {{< hl-text blue>}}population share by building types{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from Marinova et. al (2019)[^7]. The floor area per capita in each region differs by scenario and is discussed in the Scenario generation section (see below). The region classification is shown in Region classification section (see below).

Note that although we mainly consider social-economic factors (i.e., population and floor area per person) as the driver of the global demand in building stocks. {{< hl-text orange>}}There are other factors that will impact future building stocks and could be modelled in future work (using different modelling approaches). For example, the increasing frequency and severity of climate changes may create extra building demand as a complement for those damaged by natural disasters{{< /hl-text >}}[^8] , {{< hl-text orange>}}or abandoned in areas declared uninhabitable{{< /hl-text >}}[^9].

## Material demand layer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141774532-d44da1d4-265f-4cff-a4a5-e57eef5e2d8f.png)

Materials inflow in year 𝑡 , defined as 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) , is calculated by multiplying building inflow with materials use intensity per floor area in year 𝑡, denoted as 𝑀𝐼(𝑡). {{< hl-text orange>}}We include seven major building materials, i.e. steel, concrete, brick, aluminium, copper, wood, and glass.{{< /hl-text >}} Detailed material density data is included in the Scenario generation section (see below).
As shown in equation (6), the materials outflow in year 𝑡, denoted by 𝑀𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡), is determined by the cumulative sum of the floor area of demolished buildings in year 𝑡 (i.e. 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′) ∗ A𝑖𝑛(𝑡′)), and the material intensity in year 𝑡′(i.e. 𝑀𝐼(𝑡′)), when the demolished buildings were built.

## Material supply layer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141806008-c5e3b627-7574-412a-804a-5d8e1c0536a4.png)

Materials demand can be met by primary production, secondary production, or reuse and their emission
intensities differ significantly (cradle-to-gate emission intensity is 0 for reused materials). In equation (7), 𝑃𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑆𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) denote the {{< hl-text blue>}}quantities of materials supplied by primary and secondary production{{< /hl-text >}} respectively, while 𝑃𝐸𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑆𝐸𝐼(𝑡) represent the {{< hl-text blue>}}GHG emission intensity of the cradle-to-gate life cycle primary and secondary material production{{< /hl-text >}}, respectively. 𝑃𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑆𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) can be calculated by equation (8) and (9) respectively, where 𝑅𝑈𝑟(𝑡) and 𝑅𝐶𝑟(𝑡) represent the {{< hl-text blue>}}reuse and recycling rate of building materials{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e., the percentage of post-consumer material scraps that are collected for reuse or to produce secondary materials, respectively. {{< hl-text red>}}Note that here are some inherent assumptions: 1) we only consider the recycling and reuse of {{< hl-text blue>}}the newly generated material outflows{{< /hl-text >}}, which means the {{< hl-text blue>}}historical scraps{{< /hl-text >}} would not be considered for recycling and reuse in the future; 2) we only consider the recycling and reuse of material outflows {{< hl-text blue>}}within the same region, area, and building type{{< /hl-text >}}, which means {{< hl-text blue>}}cross-regional scraps{{< /hl-text >}}, for example, are not considered for recycling and reuse; 3) we assume that the secondary materials provide the same service as the primary materials, that is, a 1:1 substitution between primary and secondary materials in mass terms.{{< /hl-text >}} Under these assumptions, our circularity model should be taken as a simplified approach for short-term scenario analysis where material inflows are generally larger than outflows. However, in the longer-term (i.e. beyond 2060) when material outflows largely outstrip inflows, it could be important to consider the potential of using historical scrap reserves and scraps moving across regions/areas/building types.  {{< hl-text orange>}}𝑃𝐸𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑆𝐸𝐼(𝑡) are calculated using the life cycle assessment (LCA) model based on the life cycle inventory database eco-invent{{< /hl-text >}}, with emission intensities for unit processes specified per world region, and which we further specified for future moments in time (more information about the LCA model can be found in section Scenario evaluation in this document).

# 2. Region and income group classification

Supplementary Table 1 below shows the 26 world regions in this research and the countries or sub-regions included in each world region. We further classify the {{< hl-text blue>}}26 regions{{< /hl-text >}} into {{< hl-text blue>}}3 income groups{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e., {{< hl-text blue>}}high-income, upper-middle-income, and low- & lower-middle-income groups{{< /hl-text >}} according to the World Bank
Atlas classification[^10] (see Supplementary Table 2). Note that we report results for the low-income and lower-middle-income regions together for ease of inspection.
