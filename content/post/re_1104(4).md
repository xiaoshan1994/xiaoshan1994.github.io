# 1. Model framework
The overall model framework is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. It is comprised of a building demand module, a material demand module, and a material supply module. Each module is described in turn.

Supplementary Figure 1. The conceptual framework of the GloBUME model. This dynamic GloBUME model (global dynamic building materials use and embodied GHG emissions model) consists of three layers, i.e. a building demand layer, a material demand layer, and a material supply layer. Two rectangles
in the center represent stocks of floor area and materials respectively, ovals denote flows, hexagons are
the drivers or determinants. Colors indicate drivers given by each scenario, driven by related strategies
illustrated in the rounded rectangles filled with the same colors. Data and codes details are freely
available from the link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171943.

## Building demand layer
In the building demand layer, the dynamic building stock and flows are calculated by the following equations:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141764065-3ea2a76a-734a-4be0-9e4b-f61a2441b28c.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141764143-9f232b64-b5e7-478c-9aec-4eb29b5573d6.png)

Equation (1) describes the fundamental balance between stocks and flows of building floor area, where A(𝑡) denotes the building demand in year 𝑡, and is the key driver of the model, determined by population, denoted by 𝑃(𝑡), and floor area per capita, denoted by A𝑝(𝑡), as shown in Equation (2) and Supplementary Figure 1. A𝑖𝑛(𝑡) represents the building inflow in year t and is determined by the increase in building demand, calculated by 𝐴(𝑡)− 𝐴(𝑡 −1), and the building outflow, represented by A𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡). {{< hl-text orange>}}The building outflow in year 𝑡, defined as the demolition of buildings which were built in different years before year 𝑡, is determined by the cohort and the building’s lifetime distribution function.{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< alert info>}} Is it possible to involve stock changes caused by climate change factors, flood or other potential factors instead demolition only?{{< /alert >}}

As shown in equation (3), 𝑡′(𝑡′< 𝑡) represents the year in which the building was constructed, and 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′) denotes the probability that the buildings built in year 𝑡′ will be demolished in year 𝑡. We assume buildings’ lifetime follows the {{< hl-text orange>}}Weibull distribution (韦伯分配){{< /hl-text >}}and use the equation (4) to calculate 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′), where 𝜆(𝑡) and 𝑘(𝑡) represent the scale parameter and the shape parameter in year 𝑡 , respectively. Note that the functional form for the lifetime distributions can have a considerable impact on the calculation of outflow and inflow.[^1] {{< hl-text orange>}}Other functional forms{{< /alert >}}, {{< hl-text orange>}}e.g., normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^2], {{< hl-text orange>}}Log-normal{{< /hl-text >}}[^3], {{< hl-text orange>}}and Gamma functions{{< /hl-text >}}[^4] {{< hl-text orange>}}have also used in material related dynamic analysis. However, the Weibull distribution is the most common in the literature, and is therefore the distribution for which the most reliable data are available{{< /hl-text >}}[^5].

This study covers 4 types of residential buildings (detached houses, semi-detached houses, apartments, and high-rise buildings) in 2 areas (urban, and rural) and 4 types of commercial buildings (offices, retails & warehouses, hotels & restaurants, and Other commercial buildings) in 26 global regions. The {{< hl-text blue>}}data on population{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from the integrated assessment model of IMAGE[^6]. The {{< hl-text blue>}}population share by building types{{< /hl-text >}} are derived from Marinova et. al (2019)[^7]. The floor area per capita in each region differs by scenario and is discussed in the Scenario generation section (see below). The region classification is shown in Region classification section (see below).

Note that although we mainly consider social-economic factors (i.e., population and floor area per person) as the driver of the global demand in building stocks. {{< hl-text orange>}}There are other factors that will impact future building stocks and could be modelled in future work (using different modelling approaches). For example, the increasing frequency and severity of climate changes may create extra building demand as a complement for those damaged by natural disasters{{< /hl-text >}}[^8] , {{< hl-text orange>}}or abandoned in areas declared uninhabitable{{< /hl-text >}}[^9].

## Material demand layer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141774532-d44da1d4-265f-4cff-a4a5-e57eef5e2d8f.png)

Materials inflow in year 𝑡 , defined as 𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) , is calculated by multiplying building inflow with materials use intensity per floor area in year 𝑡, denoted as 𝑀𝐼(𝑡). {{< hl-text orange>}}We include seven major building materials, i.e. steel, concrete, brick, aluminium, copper, wood, and glass.{{< /hl-text >}} Detailed material density data is included in the Scenario generation section (see below).
As shown in equation (6), the materials outflow in year 𝑡, denoted by 𝑀𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡), is determined by the cumulative sum of the floor area of demolished buildings in year 𝑡 (i.e. 𝐿(𝑡,𝑡′) ∗ A𝑖𝑛(𝑡′)), and the material intensity in year 𝑡′(i.e. 𝑀𝐼(𝑡′)), when the demolished buildings were built.

## Material supply layer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/141806008-c5e3b627-7574-412a-804a-5d8e1c0536a4.png)

Materials demand can be met by primary production, secondary production, or reuse and their emission
intensities differ significantly (cradle-to-gate emission intensity is 0 for reused materials). In equation (7), 𝑃𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑆𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) denote the {{< hl-text blue>}}quantities of materials supplied by primary and secondary production{{< /hl-text >}} respectively, while 𝑃𝐸𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑆𝐸𝐼(𝑡) represent the {{< hl-text blue>}}GHG emission intensity of the cradle-to-gate life cycle primary and secondary material production{{< /hl-text >}}, respectively. 𝑃𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑆𝑀𝑖𝑛(𝑡) can be calculated by equation (8) and (9) respectively, where 𝑅𝑈𝑟(𝑡) and 𝑅𝐶𝑟(𝑡) represent the {{< hl-text blue>}}reuse and recycling rate of building materials{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e., the percentage of post-consumer material scraps that are collected for reuse or to produce secondary materials, respectively. {{< hl-text red>}}Note that here are some inherent assumptions: 1) we only consider the recycling and reuse of {{< hl-text blue>}}the newly generated material outflows{{< /hl-text >}}, which means the {{< hl-text blue>}}historical scraps{{< /hl-text >}} would not be considered for recycling and reuse in the future; 2) we only consider the recycling and reuse of material outflows {{< hl-text blue>}}within the same region, area, and building type{{< /hl-text >}}, which means {{< hl-text blue>}}cross-regional scraps{{< /hl-text >}}, for example, are not considered for recycling and reuse; 3) we assume that the secondary materials provide the same service as the primary materials, that is, a 1:1 substitution between primary and secondary materials in mass terms.{{< /hl-text >}}
{{< alert info >}} If we can handle the above limitations in our new research? Extending the boundary of secondary production materials? {{< /alert >}}
Under these assumptions, our circularity model should be taken as a simplified approach for short-term scenario analysis where material inflows are generally larger than outflows. However, in the longer-term (i.e. beyond 2060) when material outflows largely outstrip inflows, it could be important to consider the potential of using historical scrap reserves and scraps moving across regions/areas/building types.  {{< hl-text orange>}}𝑃𝐸𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑆𝐸𝐼(𝑡) are calculated using the life cycle assessment (LCA) model based on the life cycle inventory database eco-invent{{< /hl-text >}}, with emission intensities for unit processes specified per world region, and which we further specified for future moments in time (more information about the LCA model can be found in section Scenario evaluation in this document).

# 2. Region and income group classification

Supplementary Table 1 below shows the 26 world regions in this research and the countries or sub-regions included in each world region. We further classify the {{< hl-text blue>}}26 regions{{< /hl-text >}} into {{< hl-text blue>}}3 income groups{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e., {{< hl-text blue>}}high-income, upper-middle-income, and low- & lower-middle-income groups{{< /hl-text >}} according to the World Bank Atlas classification[^10]\(see Supplementary Table 2). Note that we report results for the low-income and lower-middle-income regions together for ease of inspection.

# 3. Scenario generation
Our model described above provides an approach of scenario explorations based on customized development trends. {{< hl-text orange>}}Note that our investigations here represent what-if scenarios rather than an accurate prediction of the future.{{< /hl-text >}} We follow Deetman et al., 2020[^5], in {{< hl-text orange>}}assuming that some variables (e.g., building lifespan, and material intensity) have remained constant in the pre-2020 period based on 2020 levels (for more details see Deetman et al., 2020{{< /hl-text >}}[^5]). For variables where historical data is available (e.g., for population, and GDP) year-specific data was used. For the future, the Baseline scenario represents a reference case where the historical trends in the building sectors around the world largely continue. The High Efficiency scenario represents a deep emission mitigation scenario where the seven strategies will be simultaneously adopted. Please see below for the full details of the strategies in each scenario.

## M1-More intensive use

More intensive use represents the potential to decouple the housing demand (per capita floor area) from economic development. In the Baseline scenario, the residential floor area per capita sees increasing trends, in line with the IMAGE-SSP2 baseline scenario[^6] (IMAGE data is allocated to the four building types according to Marinova et al. 2019[^7]). The commercial floor area per capita towards 2050 is collected from Deetman et al. (2020){{< hl-text orange>}}[^5] and then extended to 2060 using the {{< hl-text blue>}}same regression model{{< /hl-text >}} as that used in the original study{{< /hl-text >}}[^5]. In the High Efficiency scenario, we adopt the assumption from the literature that sees a potential for {{< hl-text blue>}}20% reduction{{< /hl-text >}}[^12] from the Baseline values by 2050. It is noteworthy that in the High Efficiency scenario, in general, the floor area per capita will still increase (at a lower speed than in the Baseline scenario) in the rapidly urbanizing regions but slightly decrease in the highly urbanized regions. As such, the floor space gap between the rich and poorer regions will be narrowed. In future work, it may be worth exploring a more realistic and region-specific implementation of a more-intensive-use scenario, for example by adjusting the per capita floorspace differently for urban and rural areas. This would ideally account for the various drivers of floorspace demand trends (such as high demand & prices in densely populated areas) and make sure that assumptions are not at odds with achieving decent living standards or the Sustainable Development Goals[^13].

## M2-Lifetime extension

Short-lived buildings lead to frequent demolition of old buildings and construction of new buildings. The construction activities are associated with large amounts of building materials and GHG emissions. Therefore, prolonging service life of buildings can reduce the construction of new buildings and therefore avoid materials consumption and emissions[^14][^15]. Today, the service life of buildings is fairly short and sees a potential of up to 90% extension by 2050[^12]. Based on the literature[^1][^5][^16], we assume that the service life of buildings follows the Weibull distribution. For residential buildings, we derive Weibull parameters
(shape and scale) from Deetman et al. (2020)[^5], which differ by region and the building type where possible (see details in Table S.3). We then classify the 26 regions into three groups according to the average lifetime of the buildings in each region (Supplementary Table 6). {{< hl-text orange>}}For commercial buildings, we employ a shape parameter of 1.44 and a scale parameter of 49.6 on the global average, according to the same study{{< /hl-text >}}[^5].

Under the Baseline scenario, we assume that the lifetime of buildings will stay at the current level. In the High Efficiency scenario, {{< hl-text orange>}}we assume a lifetime extension by {{< hl-text blue>}}30%{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}60%{{< /hl-text >}}, and {{< hl-text blue>}}90%{{< /hl-text >}} by 2050 for residential buildings newly constructed in the regions classified as having long-, medium-, and short-lifetimes, respectively (see Supplementary Table 4).{{< /hl-text >}} Similar assumptions are found in the literature[^12], which assumed a 90% lifetime extension by 2050 in several countries. {{< hl-text orange>}}We assume a lifetime extension by {{< hl-text blue>}}60%{{< /hl-text >}} for newly constructed commercial buildings by 2050.{{< /hl-text >}}

## M3-Lightweight design
Today’s construction practices often overuse materials due to less efficient design or a relatively low physical strength of primary materials[^17][^18]. There is a potential for lightweighting through more advanced design strategies including novel structural design[^19], typology optimization[^20], additive construction (such as 3D printing)[^21], and high strength steel and aluminium utilization[^22]. For the Baseline scenario, we assume that material use intensity will stay at the current level. We used the {{< hl-text blue>}}material density of steel, concrete, copper, aluminium, glass, and wood by building type per region{{< /hl-text >}} from Marinova et. al[^7] and Deetman et. al[^5]. Given that the material intensity for {{< hl-text blue>}}brick{{< /hl-text >}} was missing in these works we used values based on multiple other peer-reviewed studies (see Supplementary Table 5). Since China is the largest brick producer (producing over 60% of the world total[^23]), we also derive a specific brick dataset for
China. Given the lack of data, we applied a global average for other regions. In the High Efficiency scenario, {{< hl-text orange>}}we assume that the material intensities of steel and aluminium will linearly decrease in the future reaching a reduction of 19% [^17][^18] by 2050. A reduction by 10% is assumed for concrete.{{< /hl-text >}} The assumptions are somewhat more conservative than some national scenarios[^12][^24] to account for the fact that there may be regulatory resistance and delays across the world.  {{< hl-text orange>}}The intensities of other materials are assumed to remain constant.{{< /hl-text >}}

## M4-Material substitution

Timber houses are generally considered an environmentally friendly substitution for steel and concrete
structures for two reasons: firstly, using timber can avoid considerable emissions during material
production processes39; secondly, timber can serve as long-term carbon storage if sources sustainably40
.
However, there are also concerns surrounding land-use change to manage forests and related biodiversity
loss41, especially in rapidly growing Asian and African regions. In the Baseline scenario, we assume no
additional timber substitution compared to the current level. In the High Efficiency scenario, we assume
that a 10% higher timber substitution (following a liner increase as of 2020) is achieved in new buildings
by 2050. That is, a fraction (10% in 2050, for example) of new buildings are designed as wood-based
while other buildings conform to the Baseline material intensity (or the light-weighted intensity when
light-weight design is applied). Globally a 10% timber substitution by 2050 has been investigated as a
reasonable strategy given forest sustainability and capacity to manufacture mass-timber products42
, despite being more conservative compared to other scenarios in the literature which see 50% or even 90%
scenarios12, 42
. We derive the material intensity of the typical timber building systems from several
studies42, 43, 44 (see Supplementary Table 6). We mainly consider the change in the intensity of steel,
concrete and wood. Other materials (e.g., gypsum, glass) are relatively insignificant and are therefore
not considered. Similar with Churkina et al., 202042, we do not consider timber-based substitution for
‘High-rise’ buildings due to regulation and technological concerns. In future work, it may be interesting
to apply different substitution strategies across regions and building types, especially when exploring
more ambitious substitution scenarios12
. Carbon storage is not considered in this study.
