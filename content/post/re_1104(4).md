# 1. Model framework
The overall model framework is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. It is comprised of a building demand module, a material demand module, and a material supply module. Each module is described in turn.

Supplementary Figure 1. The conceptual framework of the GloBUME model. This dynamic GloBUME model (global dynamic building materials use and embodied GHG emissions model) consists of three layers, i.e. a building demand layer, a material demand layer, and a material supply layer. Two rectangles
in the center represent stocks of floor area and materials respectively, ovals denote flows, hexagons are
the drivers or determinants. Colors indicate drivers given by each scenario, driven by related strategies
illustrated in the rounded rectangles filled with the same colors. Data and codes details are freely
available from the link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5171943.

## Building demand layer
In the building demand layer, the dynamic building stock and flows are calculated by the following equations:
