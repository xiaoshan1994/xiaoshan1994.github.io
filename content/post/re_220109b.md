# Abstract
Three objectives of a EU-funded project(EXIOPOL, “A New Environmental Accounting Framework Using Externality Data and Input–Output Tools for Policy Analysis”):
1. Estimates of the {{< hl-text blue>}}external costs{{< /hl-text >}} of key environmental impacts for Europe;
2. Develop an EE IO framework for the EU-27 in a global context;
3. Apply the results of the work to external costs and EE I–O for illustrative policy questions.

# 1. Introduction: the goals of EXIOPOL

The aim of this project providing insights into:
1. The direct (net) costs of implementing a sustainability measure;
2. The reduction of environmental impacts associated with its implementation.
3. The (reduction of) so-called ‘external costs’ from the reduction of impacts associated with the measure.

* Sustainability measures taken at a micro (e.g. company), meso (e.g. sector) and macro (e.g. country or multi-country) level can have ‘ripple effects’, or spillovers, at another level.
