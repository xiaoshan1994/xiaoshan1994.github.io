## B Take
Hi, Jean,

We’re so glad we decided to **take a holiday** here. Yesterday we **took a trip** to the mountains. First we **took a train** to a little town and then we **took a bus** going to various villages and got off when we saw one that we **took a liking to**. Of course, we were **taking a risk** as we didn’t know exactly what we’d find there. But we were lucky. Some kids **took an interest** in us and showed us some great places. We took a lot of photos.

Have you done anything yet about your job? I’d **take a chance** and leave if I
were you. No point in staying somewhere where the boss has **taken a dislike**
to you! Take advantage of being in London – there are always plenty of jobs
there. You’ll soon find something else, so take action, that’s my advice! Good
luck!
