1. How to measure the plastic footprint?
2. how much plastic waste is exported every year? Where is the waste flow of each country going? Avoiding waste import or improving waste management infrastructure? which one could be better in developing countries?
3. What is the environmental impact of these abroad plastic waste on the local environmental? How to measure them?
4. How much {{< hl-text blue>}}plastic leakage(or 'ocean plastic waste'){{< /hl-text >}} will be induced due to plastic imports in those countries? Followed with how much emissions will be caused? (We have mapped plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean by each country(**coastal countries**), but we don't connect it with plastic trade. Check the relationship between them. Do they only account for the production or consumption in a country.)
5. if it is possible to measure Chinese plastic leakage, or counting for the transport and cloth sectors?/*
