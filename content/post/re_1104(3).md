# REVIEWER COMMENTS

This contribution is focused on a crucial GHG mitigation area, GHG emissions embodied in construction materials, and seeks to close a crucial gap in the international analysis, {{< hl-text orange>}}to develop consistent global scenarios for that area.{{< /hl-text >}} I consider the contribution overall both informative and in many aspects well done. There are the following concerns, which I advise to be taken care of before publication can be considered:

(1) One of the main conclusions of the paper is that – in order to remain within a 1.5 degree target carbon budget - either the strategies mentioned have to be significantly further increased in strictness or other sectors have to mitigate more (both in the abstract and in lines 374-378). This leaves out an actually already pursued third option. {{< hl-text orange>}}This third option is mentioned in the article, although only for the long-term: (Lines 246-248) “Third, substantial GHG emissions can be reduced in steel and cement production through various carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, such as chemical absorption55, calcium looping56, and cement carbonation20, 57, among others56. These technologies are yet to be fully commercialized and may only play a significant role in reducing emission intensities in the longer term”. (from the context one would assume that longer-term refers to basically post-2060).{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}However, these technological options are already available at laboratory scale, so could be employed significantly sooner than the article seems to imply.{{< /hl-text >}} These options thus need to be discussed more inherently and considered in the scenarios, not just to be referred to as “future options”.

(2) The strategies seem to miss out significant further options. E.g. what I am told by building specialists consistently over the last years is {{< hl-text orange>}}a further significant strategy to reduce the material amount of concrete in ceilings (identically weight proof with 40-70% less concrete, and accordingly less cement), by returning to shuttering formworks as used in the early days of concrete, when it was much more expensive than labor. The new “empty segments” won could be used by activated building components, such as for storing heat (new value added chains). My suggestion is to expand for at least mentioning both such technological strategies and their integrated embedding into comprehensive overall strategies.

This is also a question of the approach. When we know that carbon neutrality is our target, such {{< hl-text orange>}}more integrative and comprehensive solutions will be sought, beyond the (somewhat narrower) strategies
already mentioned in Table 1.{{< /hl-text >}}

(3) The argument that non-CO2 emissions are hardly relevant for GHG emissions (of the building material sector) and thus a look at the carbon budget only (CO2 only) suffices, should be discussed sector, and what trends could have it increase (increased relevance of insulation material), and whether we might really neglect it (as we do have a robust emissions budget for CO2 only (given the much shorter lifetime of most non-CO2 GHG emissions). But note, that non-CO2 emissions and their development do have a crucial implication on the temperature targets achieved (Figure SPM.1 of the IPCC SR 1.5 degrees).

(4) Related to that issue: {{< hl-text orange>}}How are building related GHG emissions quantified? Do you rely on a production-based accounting method, or do you – which should be the case here, at least as an alternative and possibly a sensitivity analysis – also take account of the indirect emissions{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e. base your analysis on a consumption-based accounting approach, e.g. {{< hl-text orange>}}including emissions from electricity generation if electricity is used as an intermediate input in producing construction material.{{< /hl-text >}} This refers to both, the current status (as given e.g. in the caption of Figure 3 – 8.1% of current GHG emissions), and in the BAU and high efficiency scenario, which both are demanding for a consumption base accounting approach. (I would expect building related emissions to account for a higher share of emissions under the consumption-based approach, which actually is a final demand allocation approach).

(5) Further issues:

a. To avoid any potential misunderstandings you might want to add the explicit information that all
your numbers in the abstract in line 22-23 refer to “building material related GHG emissions” only.
Similarly, in the results section (lines 121-124).

b. For the “tradeoff between pre-use and in-use emissions whereby highly energy-efficient buildings
may require more materials in construction” (lines 47-48)) there is more recent and comprehensive
work then cited so far, in particular in the recent special issue of Buildings and Cities
(https://www.buildingsandcities.org/journal-content/special-issues/carbon-metrics.html ), with the
trade-off explicitly discussed under a carbon budget setting in https://doi.org/10.5334/bc.32, which
also supplies a transparent argument for larger shares of the carbon budget for certain sectors, in
particular building material related GHG emissions, given the high share of investment demand in
demand for such goods. You might want to consider this argument also for your purposes.

c. Lines 132-134 (and Figure 1, Panel D): that is also a matter of country size /while I understand why
the absolute amount is of relevance to you here, reconsider (at least for the SI) a figure with a scaling
of vertical axis rather as per capita?

d. Aggregation: Lines 151ff (and Figure 2): Mention how you aggregate these, as potentials clearly
overlap.

e. Line 163ff: Note that the three layers exactly match and thus you might want to relate them to the
general framework of Avoid - Shift - Improve (Creutzig et al, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-
018-0121-1 )

f. Typos: line 201 (infrastructure), line 441 (“that”)

g. Line 234-235: “The fact that several building materials are produced by difficult to decarbonize
sectors, such as steel and cement production, presents a serious challenge” – see my main points (1)
and (2) above, which need to be discussed in that context here as well, them offering a clear (and
earlier) way out.
