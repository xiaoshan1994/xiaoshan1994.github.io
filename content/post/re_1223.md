# Abstract

Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) largely relied on partial or general equilibrium models which can integrate market effects but have poor resolutions of the sectoral definition and the assumption of perfect oversight by all economic agents. A new Technology Choice Model (TCM) has been introduced to incorporate parameter uncertainties and suboptimal decisions due to market imperfections and information asymmetry in a stochastic setting. A case focused on rice production.

# Introduction

* CLCA could determine the environmental consequences of decisions such as {{< hl-text blue>}}the introduction of a new technology{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}implementing a new policy{{< /hl-text >}}, or {{< hl-text blue>}}an increase in product demand{{< /hl-text >}}. Debate arises regarding its {{< hl-text blue>}}operational models{{< /hl-text >}} for technology choices and uncertainty implications.
* CLCA heavily relies on partial equilibrium (PE) and computational general equilibrium (CGE) models for modelling market effects.
* The advantages of both PE and CGE models lies in their ability to determine the quantity and price of products jointly based on econometrically derived underlying data. Also, covering multiple regions.
* The disadvantages are underlying theoretical assumptions will not be observed in real markets, e.g. economic agents may make suboptimal decisions due to imperfect information, which will not lead to a global optimum assumed by those models. Besides, Since all markets are equilibrium, prices and demands are determined by fixed elasticities based on outdated values or proxy data. Also, it is not suitable for modelling changes introduced at a detailed process-level, or determining substitution effects among alternative technologies serving the same market.
* CLCA is often exposed to large uncertainties. Main source arises from modelling changes from the composition of technology mixes. One test way is to set multiple scenarios showing the range of potential outcomes under different assumptions. But it leads to an extremely wide range and is often based on subjective choice of selective scenarios.
* Also Analytical Error Propagation and Monte Carlo simulation have been used in LCA uncertainty assessments but not typically applied to them since they make independent choices from the mathematical formulation.

# Basic Structure of the Technology Choice Model (TCM)

## Generalized calculus for LCA

* Matrix A shows the exchange of intermediate flows (functional flows), where the coefficient $a_{ij}$ indicates the production (>0) or consumption (<0) amount. For an invertible technology matrix A and a given functional unit vector f, a scaling vector s can be calculated from:
$$S = A^{-1}f(1)$$
