* {{< hl-text blue>}}Global plastic waste trade networks (GPWTNs){{< /hl-text >}} from {{< hl-text blue>}}1988 to 2017{{< /hl-text >}} are established.
* The direct and indirect impacts of {{< hl-text blue>}}China’s import ban{{< /hl-text >}} on the GPWTNs are evaluated.
* Data derived from United Nations Commodity Trade Database (UN-Comtrade, see http://comtrade.un.org/), covering bilateral trade flows among countries. The code of {{< hl-text blue>}}plastic waste{{< /hl-text >}} is {{< hl-text blue>}}HS 3915{{< /hl-text >}}, which represents waste, parings and scrap of plastics. The units of measurement are available as both the {{< hl-text blue>}}net weight (kg){{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}value (US dollar){{< /hl-text >}}.
* Considering China and Hongkong separately regarding Hongkong's special position as an international re-exporting port.

* Dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) for quanfying and predicting post-consumer packaging waste from express delivery involves the following steps:
  1. Determine the delivery quantity from the sum of the amount of inter- and intra-city parcels in a given year.
  2.
