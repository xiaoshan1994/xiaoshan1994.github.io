* {{< hl-text blue>}}Global plastic waste trade networks (GPWTNs){{< /hl-text >}} from {{< hl-text blue>}}1988 to 2017{{< /hl-text >}} are established.
* The direct and indirect impacts of {{< hl-text blue>}}China’s import ban{{< /hl-text >}} on the GPWTNs are evaluated.
* Data derived from United Nations Commodity Trade Database (UN-Comtrade, see http://comtrade.un.org/), covering bilateral trade flows among countries.

* Dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) for quanfying and predicting post-consumer packaging waste from express delivery involves the following steps:
  1. Determine the delivery quantity from the sum of the amount of inter- and intra-city parcels in a given year.
  2. Determine the total weight of all types of packaging materials.
  3. Determine the EoL(end-of-life) flows for each packaging material type.

## Abstract

* Trying to provide with a comprehensive quantification of {{< hl-text orange>}}{{< hl-text blue>}}plastics losses{{< /hl-text >}} in the world{{< /hl-text >}} in {{< hl-text blue>}}2015{{< /hl-text >}}, covering varied regions, polymers and plastics value chains.
* Approximately {{< hl-text blue>}}6.2 Mt{{< /hl-text >}} (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.0–20.4 Mt) of {{< hl-text blue>}}macroplastics{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}3.0 Mt{{< /hl-text >}} (CI: 1.5–5.2 Mt) of {{< hl-text blue>}}microplastics{{< /hl-text >}} were lost to the environment in {{< hl-text blue>}}2015{{< /hl-text >}}.
* The major macroplastic loss source was the {{< hl-text blue>}}mismanaged municipal solid waste (MSW) management{{< /hl-text >}} in {{< hl-text blue>}}low-income and lower-middle income countries.{{< /hl-text >}} For microplastics, the major sources were {{< hl-text blue>}}abrasion of tyre rubbers{{< /hl-text >}}, abrasion of road markings and plastics contributing to city dust generation.

## 1. Introduction

* Previous studies narrowed the system scope, e.g. parts of the world, specific polymers or only parts of the plastic life cycle.
* Cross-references to an UN Environment report (Mapping of Global Plastic Value Chain and Plastic losses to the Environment (with a particular focus on marine environment)).

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Global plastic production and consumption

* Production data complied with different regions is mainly from {{< hl-text blue>}}PlasticsEurope 2016{{< /hl-text >}} and consumption data is direved from {{< hl-text blue>}}Plastics Insight 2016{{< /hl-text >}}.
* Divided the world into 11 regions.
