# In a nutshell
* Understand how and where plastic is distributing.
* To what degree of degradation microbial communities have an impact on the plastics.
* What alternative options to minimize the use and mismanagement of plastic exist.
* Focus on environmental impacts in ***Trondheimsfjord*** in Norway, combining filed studies, laboratory studies and computer modelling in an interdisciplinary approach.
# Job description
1. Modelling plastic debris transport and accumulation
*Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering*
The aim is to develop a numerical model cascade predicting the transport and accumulation of plastic debris along with their transport pathways from source to sink. We will focus on identifying pathways and repositories of marine plastic waste. The numerical modeling is based on the open-source hydrodynamics framework REEF3D.
