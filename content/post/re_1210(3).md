# In a nutshell
* Understand how and where plastic is distributing.
* To what degree of degradation microbial communities have an impact on the plastics.
* What alternative options to minimize the use and mismanagement of plastic exist.
* Focus on environmental impacts in ***Trondheimsfjord*** in Norway, combining filed studies, laboratory studies and computer modelling in an interdisciplinary approach.
# Job description
1. Modelling plastic debris transport and accumulation
*Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering*
The aim is to develop a numerical model cascade predicting the transport and accumulation of plastic debris along with their transport pathways from source to sink. We will focus on identifying pathways and repositories of marine plastic waste. The numerical modelling is based on the open-source hydrodynamics framework REEF3D.
2. Plastics in sediments
*Department of Geography*
The aim is to map and sample marine plastic debris in Trondheimsfjord and the outer, central coast of Norway. Strong connections to the other 3 positions exist through ground-truthing, assessing the role of microbial communities and determining the sources and types of plastic debris in the study area.
3. Microbial biofilms and degradation processes on microplastic debris
*Department of Biology*
The aim is to characterize microbial biofilms in relation to plastic type/age and to assess their impact on the degree of plastic degradation by considering environmental conditions, plastic type, and surface characteristics. The position involves both fieldwork in Trondheimsfjorden and the Froan archipelago and laboratory analyses.
