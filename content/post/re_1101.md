# Highlights
* We estimate impacts of five mechanisms on nations’ CO2 emissions over 1970–2016
* Without these mechanisms, emissions grow as fast as the economy
* Energy system decarbonization was the primary mechanism for high-income countries
* Productivity gains were the primary mechanism for low-income countries

# Science for society
{{< hl-text orange>}}Fearing negative repercussions (/ˌriːpəˈkʌʃən/)[^reper] for economic growth, climate policy is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement temperature target.{{< /hl-text >}} However, the academic literature disagrees on both the impact of economic growth on climate mitigation and the effectiveness of various mitigation mechanisms on CO2 emissions reduction. Here, we investigate the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in 73 countries during the period 1970–2016. We find that in the absence of mitigation mechanisms, emissions would have indeed grown at the same rate as the economy. However, these five mechanisms—energy system decarbonization, electrification, increased economic productivity, deindustrialization, and winter warming—are identified as successfully reducing emissions by 19 gigatonnes, mostly during periods of economic growth. Yet, observations indicate that emissions reduction rates consistent with the Paris Agreement could be achieved while maintaining economic growth only if energy systems are more rapidly decarbonized.

[^reper]: (repercussion) the effects of an action or event, especially bad effects that continue for some time.

# Summary

Nations must curtail carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 7% per annum to meet the Paris Agreement temperature targets. A perceived economic growth-climate mitigation trade-off has diminished political will to act. However, there is no scholarly consensus regarding the magnitude of the trade-off between economic growth and CO2 mitigation and a lack of ex post evidence regarding the extent to which mitigation measures can effectively lower CO2 emissions. Here, we present a structural equation model integrating emissions and economic and energy system characteristics over the period 1970–2016 to empirically assess mechanisms that influence the GDP-CO2 relationship for 73 countries. Robust to various model specifications and statistical tests, we found a simple unitary scale effect between per capita GDP and per capita CO2 emissions, while five emission-reduction mechanisms, principally energy system decarbonization and productivity gains, collectively contributed to global emission reductions by 19 petagrams. Within the observed year-to-year emissions development, reductions at a rate consistent with the Paris Agreement can be achieved in about 10% of instances while maintaining economic growth.
