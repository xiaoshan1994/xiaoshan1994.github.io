* Collocation means a natural combination of words; it refers to the way English words are closely associated with each other.
* Derived from Cambridge English Corpus, a vast database of real English taken from a range of sources.
* Excluded with idioms, which are a special type of collocation where a fixed group of words has a meaning that cannot be guessed from the surface.
