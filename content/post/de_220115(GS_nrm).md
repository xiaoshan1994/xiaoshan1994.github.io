Lanzhou: An important food townin the northwest.
All kinds of snacks can be found on itsstreets.
Even for food as common as noodles,
the people here never stoppedexploring its flavor.
[man singing in Mandarin]
Wang Hongfei. He has been makingbeef noodles for over 30 years.
If making ramen requires technique,then making the soup requires patience.
After slow-cooking for almost five hours,the beef fibers loosen,
and its flavor goes into the soup,emitting a rich aroma.
To the picky Lanzhou eaters,soup is the soul of beef noodles.
Many chefs are trying different seasoning ingredients
to achieve slight changesto the soup base's taste.
Wang Hongfei is not an exception.
Today, he chosetwo uncommon side ingredients.
At an inland cityalmost 2,000 kilometers from the ocean,
Wang Hongfei uses shrimp shellsand shrimp paste
to begin his experiment.
Crushed shrimp shellsrelease a lot of inosinic acids.
The fermented shrimp paste also releases a fresh flavor,
laying the foundation for the soup base's color.
Lastly, add white sugar.
A variety of complex aromasare magnified at this moment
and burst out together.
After cooking it for 30 minutes,the seasoning soup is done.
Add the traditional beef soup,
and a new combinationcreates an unexpected flavor.
At this point, it needs to becarefully filtered three times
in order to remove impurities,
and get a clear and fresh soup base.
[man] Two thin noodles.
[narrator] We need the guests
to check whether they likethe new experimental soup base or not.
Lanzhou noodles are the most common typeof noodles in China nowadays.
In its hometown,people define it as the taste of home.
Chefs who strive for excellenceusing picky taste buds
let this bowl of noodles that was producedby accident 100 years ago last forever.
Early in the morning each day,people would go to the side of the streets
and lovingly call it niuda.
