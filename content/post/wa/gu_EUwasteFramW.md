{{< toc >}}

The Waste Framework Directive (WFD) is a European Union Directive concerned with "measures to {{< hl-text blue>}}protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste and by reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use{{< /hl-text >}}". The first Waste Framework Directive dates back to 1975. It had previously been substantially amended in 1991 and 2006. The present directive was adopted on 19 November 2008.

One of the features of the WFD is the {{< hl-text blue>}}European Waste Hierarchy{{< /hl-text >}}.

**Key terms**: End-of-waste criteria, High quality recycling, Separate collection, Technically, environmentally and economically practicable.


# DIRECTIVE 2008/98/EC (known as the Waste Framework Directive or WFD)
[Official Journal of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32008L0098)

## Article 3 Definitions

* 2. ‘hazardous waste’ means waste which displays one or more of the hazardous properties listed in Annex III;

* 2b. ‘municipal waste’ means:
(a) mixed waste and separately collected waste from households, including {{< hl-text blue>}}paper and cardboard, glass, metals, plastics, bio-waste, wood, textiles, packaging, waste electrical and electronic equipment, waste batteries and accumulators, and bulky waste, including mattresses and furniture{{< /hl-text >}};
(b) mixed waste and separately collected waste from other sources, where such waste is similar in nature and composition to waste from households;
Municipal waste does not include waste from {{< hl-text blue>}}production, agriculture, forestry, fishing, septic tanks and sewage network and treatment{{< /hl-text >}}, including {{< hl-text blue>}}sewage sludge{{< /hl-text >}}, {{< hl-text blue>}}end-of-life vehicles{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}construction and demolition waste{{< /hl-text >}}.

* 3. ‘waste oils’ means any mineral or synthetic lubrication or industrial oils which have become unfit for the use for which they were originally intended, such as used combustion engine oils and gearbox oils, lubricating oils, oils for turbines and hydraulic oils;

* 4. ‘bio-waste’ means biodegradable garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from households, offices, restaurants, wholesale, canteens, caterers and retail premises and comparable waste from food processing plants;

* 14. ‘{{< hl-text blue>}}treatment{{< /hl-text >}}’ means recovery or disposal operations, including {{< hl-text blue>}}preparation prior to recovery or disposal{{< /hl-text >}};

* 15. ‘recovery’ means any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy. Annex II sets out a non-exhaustive list of recovery operations;

* 17. ‘recycling’ means any {{< hl-text blue>}}recovery operation{{< /hl-text >}} by which {{< hl-text blue>}}waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances{{< /hl-text >}} whether for {{< hl-text blue>}}the original or other purposes{{< /hl-text >}}. It includes the {{< hl-text blue>}}reprocessing of organic material{{< /hl-text >}} but does not include {{< hl-text blue>}}energy recovery{{< /hl-text >}} and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as {{< hl-text blue>}}fuels or for backfilling operations{{< /hl-text >}};

* 17a. ‘backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of {{< hl-text blue>}}reclamation in excavated areas or for engineering purposes in landscaping{{< /hl-text >}}. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.

19. ‘disposal’ means any operation which is not recovery even where the operation has as a secondary consequence the reclamation of substances or energy. Annex I sets out a non-exhaustive list of disposal operations;

## Article 4 Waste hierarchy

1. The following {{< hl-text blue>}}waste hierarchy{{< /hl-text >}} shall apply as a priority order in waste prevention and management legislation and policy:
(a) prevention;
(b) preparing for re-use;
(c) recycling;
(d) other recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and
(e) disposal.

## Article 9 Prevention of waste
1.  Member States shall take measures to prevent waste generation. Those measures shall, at least:
(g) reduce the generation of food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households as a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to reduce by 50 % the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains by 2030;
(h) encourage food donation and other redistribution for human consumption, prioritising human use over animal feed and the reprocessing into non-food products;
(i) promote the reduction of the content of hazardous substances in materials and products, without prejudice to harmonised legal requirements concerning those materials and products laid down at Union level, and ensure that any supplier of an article as defined in point 33 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 6 ) provides the information pursuant to Article 33(1) of that Regulation to the European Chemicals Agency as from 5 January 2021;
(k) identify products that are the main sources of littering, notably in natural and marine environments, and take appropriate measures to prevent and reduce litter from such products; where Member States decide to implement this obligation through market restrictions, they shall ensure that such restrictions are proportionate and non-discriminatory;

## Article 10 Recovery
2.  Where necessary to comply with paragraph 1 and to facilitate or improve preparing for re-use, recycling and other recovery operations, waste shall be subject to {{< hl-text blue>}}separate collection{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}shall not be mixed with other waste or other materials with different properties{{< /hl-text >}}.

## Article 11 Preparing for re-use and recycling

* 1. Subject to Article 10(2) and (3), Member States shall set up {{< hl-text blue>}}separate collection{{< /hl-text >}} at least for {{< hl-text blue>}}paper, metal, plastic and glass{{< /hl-text >}}, and, by 1 January 2025, for {{< hl-text blue>}}textiles{{< /hl-text >}}.
Member States shall take measures to promote {{< hl-text blue>}}selective demolition{{< /hl-text >}} in order to enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate re-use and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, and to ensure the establishment of {{< hl-text blue>}}sorting systems for construction and demolition waste{{< /hl-text >}} at least for wood, mineral fractions (concrete, bricks, tiles and ceramics, stones), metal, glass, plastic and plaster.

* 2. ... (c) by 2025, the{{< hl-text blue>}} preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste{{< /hl-text >}} shall be increased to a minimum of 55 % by weight;
(d) by 2030, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 60 % by weight;
(e) by 2035, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 65 % by weight.

## {{< hl-text orange>}} Article 11a Rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets{{< /hl-text >}}
* 1.  For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained:
(a) Member States shall calculate the weight of the municipal waste generated and prepared for re-use or recycled {{< hl-text blue>}}in a given calendar year{{< /hl-text >}};
(b) the weight of the municipal waste prepared for re-use shall be calculated as the weight of products or components of products that {{< hl-text blue>}}have become municipal waste{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}have undergone all necessary checking, cleaning or repairing operations{{< /hl-text >}} to enable re-use {{< hl-text blue>}}without further sorting or pre-processing{{< /hl-text >}};
(c) the weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be calculated as the weight of waste which, {{< hl-text blue>}}having undergone all necessary checking, sorting and other preliminary operations to remove waste materials{{< /hl-text >}} that are not targeted by the subsequent reprocessing and to ensure high-quality recycling, enters the recycling operation whereby waste materials are actually reprocessed into {{< hl-text blue>}}products, materials or substances{{< /hl-text >}}.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the weight of municipal waste recycled may be measured at the output of any sorting operation provided that:
(a) such output waste is subsequently recycled;
(b) the weight of materials or substances that are removed by further operations preceding the recycling operation and are not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight of waste reported as recycled.

* 3. ...technical specifications for the quality requirements of sorted waste, or {{< hl-text blue>}}average loss rates{{< /hl-text >}} for sorted waste for various waste types and waste management practices respectively. Average loss rates shall only be used in cases where reliable data cannot be obtained otherwise and shall be calculated on the basis of the calculation rules established in the delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 of this Article.

* 4. For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, the amount of municipal biodegradable waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic treatment may be counted as recycled where that treatment generates compost, digestate, or other output with {{< hl-text blue>}}a similar quantity of recycled content{{< /hl-text >}} in relation to input, which is to be used as a recycled product, material or substance. Where the output is used on land, Member States may count it as recycled only if this use results in {{< hl-text blue>}}benefits to agriculture or ecological improvement{{< /hl-text >}}.
As from 1 January 2027, Member States may count municipal bio-waste entering aerobic or anaerobic treatment as recycled only if, in accordance with Article 22, it has been separately collected or separated at source.

* 5. ...However, end-of-waste materials to be used as fuels or other means to generate energy, or to be incinerated, backfilled or landfilled, shall not be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets.

* 8. {{< hl-text blue>}}Waste exported{{< /hl-text >}} from the Union for preparing for re-use or recycling shall count towards the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 11(2) and (3) of this Directive by the Member State in which it was collected only if the requirements of paragraph 3 of this Article are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, the exporter can prove that the shipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation and that the treatment of waste outside the Union took place in conditions that are broadly equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental law.

## Article 14 Costs
* 1.  In accordance with the {{< hl-text blue>}}polluter-pays principle{{< /hl-text >}}, the costs of waste management, including for the necessary infrastructure and its operation, shall be borne by the {{< hl-text blue>}}original waste producer{{< /hl-text >}} or {{< hl-text blue>}}by the current or previous waste holders{{< /hl-text >}}.

* 2.  Without prejudice to Articles 8 and 8a, Member States may decide that the costs of waste management are to be borne {{< hl-text blue>}}partly or wholly{{< /hl-text >}} by the {{< hl-text blue>}}producer{{< /hl-text >}} of the product from which the waste came and that the {{< hl-text blue>}}distributors{{< /hl-text >}} of such product may share these costs.

## Article 21 Waste oils
* 1. ...(a) {{< hl-text blue>}}waste oils are collected separately{{< /hl-text >}}, unless separate collection is not technically feasible taking into account good practices;
(b) waste oils are treated, {{< hl-text blue>}}giving priority to regeneration {{< /hl-text >}}or alternatively to other recycling operations delivering an equivalent or a better overall environmental outcome than regeneration, in accordance with Articles 4 and 13;
(c) waste oils of different characteristics are not mixed and waste oils are not mixed with other kinds of waste or substances, if such mixing impedes their regeneration or another recycling operation delivering an equivalent or a better overall environmental outcome than regeneration.

## Article 22 Bio-waste
* 1.  Member States shall ensure that, by 31 December 2023 and subject to Article 10(2) and (3), bio-waste is either separated and recycled at source, or is collected separately and is not mixed with other types of waste.
Member States may allow waste with {{< hl-text blue>}}similar biodegradability and compostability properties{{< /hl-text >}} which complies with relevant European standards or any equivalent national standards for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation, to be {{< hl-text blue>}}collected together with bio-waste{{< /hl-text >}}.

2.  Member States shall take measures in accordance with Articles 4 and 13, to:
(a) encourage the {{< hl-text blue>}}recycling{{< /hl-text >}}, including {{< hl-text blue>}}composting and digestion{{< /hl-text >}}, of bio-waste in a way that fulfils a high level of environment protection and results in output which meets relevant high-quality standards;
(b) encourage home composting; and
(c) promote the use of materials produced from bio-waste.

## Article 23 Issue of permits
4.  It shall be a condition of any permit covering incineration or co-incineration with energy recovery that the recovery of energy take place with {{< hl-text blue>}}a high level of energy efficiency{{< /hl-text >}}.
