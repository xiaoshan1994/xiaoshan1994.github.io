[Laying down rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data on waste in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2019/1004/oj)(Text with EEA relevance.)

{{< toc >}}

(2) ... As a general rule, the recycled waste is to be measured at the point {{< hl-text blue>}}where the waste enters the recycling operation{{< /hl-text >}}. However, Member States may use a derogation and measure municipal waste {{< hl-text blue>}}at the output of a sorting operation{{< /hl-text >}}, provided that {{< hl-text blue>}}further losses due to treatment prior to the recycling operation are deducted and that the output waste is actually recycled{{< /hl-text >}}.

# Article 1 Definitions
For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:
(e) ‘calculation point’ means the point where municipal waste materials enter the recycling operation whereby waste is reprocessed into products, materials or substances that are not waste or the point where waste materials cease to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before being reprocessed;

# Article 3 Calculating recycled municipal waste pursuant to Article 11a(1), Article 11a(2) and Article 11a(5) of Directive 2008/98/EC

2. Calculation points applicable to certain waste materials and certain recycling operations are specified in Annex I.

4. ...the amount of sorted municipal waste that is {{< hl-text blue>}}rejected by the recycling facility{{< /hl-text >}} shall {{< hl-text blue>}}not be included{{< /hl-text >}} in the amount of recycled municipal waste.

## Article 4 Calculating recycled municipal bio-waste pursuant to Article 11a(4) of Directive 2008/98/EC

## {{< hl-text orange>}}ANNEX I CALCULATION POINTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 3(2){{< /hl-text >}}

Metals
Sorted metal that does not undergo further processing before entering {{< hl-text blue>}}a metal smelter or furnace{{< /hl-text >}}.

Paper/board
Sorted paper that does not undergo further processing before entering {{< hl-text blue>}}a pulping operation{{< /hl-text >}}.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Plastics{{< /hl-text >}}
**{{< hl-text orange>}}Plastic separated by polymers that does not undergo further processing before entering pelletisation, extrusion, or moulding operations.{{< /hl-text >}}**

{{< hl-text blue>}}Plastic flakes that do not undergo further processing before their use in a final product{{< /hl-text >}}.

Wood
Sorted wood that does not undergo further treatment before utilisation in {{< hl-text blue>}}particleboard manufacture{{< /hl-text >}}.

Sorted wood entering {{< hl-text blue>}}a composting operation{{< /hl-text >}}.

Textiles
Sorted textile that does not undergo further processing before its utilisation for {{< hl-text blue>}}the production of textile fibres, rags or granulates{{< /hl-text >}}.

Waste items composed of multiple materials

Plastic, glass, metal, wood, textile, paper and cardboard and other individual component materials resulting from the treatment of waste items composed of multiple materials that do not undergo further processing before reaching the calculation point established for the specific material in accordance with this Annex or with 11a of Directive 2008/98/EC and Article 3 of this Decision.

Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
