# What is municipal waste?
In our everyday lives we produce a general mix of waste in our homes, offices, schools and similar premises. This type of waste is called municipal waste. {{< hl-text blue>}}It is usually collected at kerbside or we can bring it to collection centres{{< /hl-text >}}. The amount of municipal waste generated in our country is an important measure of how wasteful our everyday lives are.

Municipal Waste includes these following waste types:
* Residual (i.e. black bin) waste e.g. waste that cannot be recycled
* Recyclable (i.e. green bin) waste e.g. glass, plastic, paper & board, metals
* Organic (i.e. brown bin) waste e.g. food and garden waste
* Bulky waste e.g. waste that cannot fit in a wheelie bin such as broken furniture, carpets, toys etc.
* Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
