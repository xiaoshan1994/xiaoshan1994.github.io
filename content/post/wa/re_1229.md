# Solid Waste
Definition from [United States Environmental Protection Agency(EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/hw/criteria-definition-solid-waste-and-solid-and-hazardous-waste-exclusions)
Any garbage or refuse, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, resulting from **industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities**.

Solid wastes are any discarded or abandoned materials. Solid wastes can be solid, liquid, semi-solid or containerized gaseous material.

# Municipal solid waste (MSW)
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste)
Known as trash or garbage in the United States and rubbish in Britain, is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality, the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology 'municipal.'
