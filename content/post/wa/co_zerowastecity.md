# Starting Scenarios to become a Zero Waste City
## Scenario 1: Starting from scratch to quickly improve waste management
https://zerowastecities.eu/tools/starting-scenarios-to-become-a-zero-waste-city/
### Baseline scenario
* Between 1 and 50,000 inhabitants: small-sized municipality
* Low waste generation between 280 and 400 kilograms of waste per
inhabitants per year
* Collection of biowaste between 0 and 20% - almost nonexistent and most
of it happening through home composting
* High reliance on disposal, mostly through landfilling. Low disposal fees

### What are the main policies to focus on?
1. Introduce sufficient separate collection infrastructure:
Based on the already existing system and {{< hl-text blue>}}complementing the bio-waste collection scheme{{< /hl-text >}}, separate collection should evolve to at least collect separately {{< hl-text blue>}}paper/cardboard, commingled plastic, metal and drinking cartons, as well as organics of course{{< /hl-text >}}.

2. Implement a separate bio-waste collection scheme:
* home-composting boxes and the setup and maintenance of community composting
* complemented with a door-to-door bio-waste collection scheme if a significant part of the population lives in dense areas within the municipality.

3. Adopt flexibility regarding the treatment of sorted and residual waste:
* Adopt a strategy prioritising waste prevention and recycling over disposal avoiding the lock-in effect that can be created after a contract for an incineration plant.

4. Start implementing and promoting waste prevention programs

# The Story of Milan - Successfully collecting food waste for over 1.4 million inhabitants
* densely populated with 1.4 million inhabitants
* 95 kilograms of food waste collected per inhabitant and an overall 62,6% waste collection rate, resulting in savings of approximately 9000 tonnes of CO2 per year.
* Average EU level on recycling of bio-waste: 16%
* the EU has made bio-waste waste[^biow] collection mandatory for all Member States by the end 2023.
* waste management company AMSA

[^biow]: According to the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC), bio-waste is “biodegradable garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from households, offices, restaurants, wholesale, canteens, caterers and retail premises and comparable waste from food-processing plants”. It means both food waste from
households or restaurants (leftovers, peels or bones) and garden waste.
