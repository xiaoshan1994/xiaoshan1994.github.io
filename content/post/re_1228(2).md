# 1. Introduction
* China's plastic waste import ban was in January 2018.
* First study quantifying the impact of China's ban on waste imports by using multiregional input-output models(GMRIO).

# 2. Materials and methods

Four models: (1) Environmentally extended multiregional input-output model; (2) Structural path analysis; (3) Ecological network analysis and (4) Hypothetical extraction method.

## 2.1. The extended multiregional input-output model
The standard Leontief demand-driven MRIO model is as follows:
$$x = Ly = (I - A)^{-1}y = (I - T\hat{x}^{-1})^{-1}y$$
After attaching the sectoral plastic waste imports vector, it can be transferred to an extended MRIO model:
$$ Q = qL\hat{y}$$
Where Q ($1 \times s$, million tons) represents the total amount of imported plastic waste consumed by sectors; q ($1 \times s$, tons/$)indicates direct plastic waste imports intensity.
This equation shows the direct and indirect imports of the plastic waste in China driven by global consumption.

## 2.2 Structural path analysis
* It can identify the essential paths in line with a specific sectoral final demand.
* End up with the fourth production layer accounting for 80% contribution.

## 2.3 Ecological network analysis

## 2.4 Hypothetical extraction method
Analysing the economic decrease assuming one or more sectors is removed from the economy.

## 2.5 Data sources
* Six groups of data: (1) the global MRIO table; (2) plastic waste imports; (3) population; (4) waste generation per capital; (5) waste composition and (6) the waste collection rate of each economy.
* **Global MRIO in 2015** is derived from Eora database.
