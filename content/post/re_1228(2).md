# 1. Introduction
* China's plastic waste import ban was in January 2018.
* First study quantifying the impact of China's ban on waste imports by using multiregional input-output models(GMRIO).

# 2. Materials and methods

Four models: (1) Environmentally extended multiregional input-output model; (2) Structural path analysis; (3) Ecological network analysis and (4) Hypothetical extraction method.

## 2.1. The extended multiregional input-output model
The standard Leontief demand-driven MRIO model is as follows:
$$x = Ly = (I - A)^{-1}y = (I - T\hat{x})^{-1}y$$

After attaching the sectoral plastic waste imports vector, it can be transferred to an extended MRIO model:
$$ Q = qL\hat{y}$$
