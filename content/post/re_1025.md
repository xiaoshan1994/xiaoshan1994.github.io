Reviewing the basic statistical concepts: expected value and variance.
<!--more-->
{{< toc >}}
# Definition of the expected value
In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable {\displaystyle X}X, often denoted E(X), E[X], or EX, is {{< hl-text orange>}}a generalization of the weighted average{{< /hl-text >}}, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent realizations of X. The expectation operator E is also commonly stylized as E or $\mathbb {E}$ . The expected value is also known as the **expectation**, **mathematical expectation**, **mean**, **average**, or **first moment**. Expected value is a key concept in economics, finance, and many other subjects.

# Expected value of a continuous or a discrete random variable

Let X be **a continuous random variable** with range [a, b] and probability
density function f(x). The expected value of X is defined by:

$$ E(x) = \int_a^b xf(x) \mathrm{d}x$$

Let’s see how this compares with the formula for **a discrete random variable**:
$$ E(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n  x_ip(x_i) $$

The discrete formula says to take a weighted sum of the values $x_i$ of X, where the weights are the probabilities $p_(x_i)$. Recall that f(x) is a probability density. Its units are prob/(unit of X).

# Definition of variance

In probability theory and statistics, {{< hl-text orange>}}variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean{{< /hl-text >}}.

$$ Var(X)= E[(X - \mu )^2]$$

Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.

Example of samples from two populations (总体) with the same mean but different variances. The red population has mean 100 and variance 100 (SD=10) while the blue population has mean 100 and variance 2500 (SD=50).

An advantage of variance as a measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to **algebraic manipulation** than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation; for example, ***the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances***. A disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that, unlike the standard deviation, ***its units differ from the random variable***, which is why **the standard deviation** is more commonly reported as a measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished.

There are two distinct concepts that are both called "variance". One, as discussed above, is part of **a theoretical probability distribution** and is **defined by an equation**. The other variance is **a characteristic of a set of observations**. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real world system. If **all** possible observations of the system are present then the calculated variance is called the {{< hl-text orange>}}population variance{{< /hl-text >}}. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the {{< hl-text orange>}}sample variance{{< /hl-text >}}. The variance calculated from a sample is considered **an estimate of the full population variance**. There are multiple ways to calculate an estimate of the population variance, as discussed in the section below.

# Variance of a continuous or a discrete random variable

If the generator of random variable X is discrete with probability mass function $x_{1} \mapsto p_{2}$, $x_{1} \mapsto p_{2}$,..., $x_{n} \mapsto p_{n}$, then
 $$ Var(X)=\sum _{i=1}^{n} p_{i}\cdot (x_{i}-\mu )^{2} $$,

 where $\mu$  is the expected value. That is,

 $$ \mu = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}x_{i} $$

If the random variable X has a probability density function f(x), and F(x) is the corresponding cumulative distribution function, then

$$ Var(X)=\sigma^{2} = \int_{\mathbb {R} }(x-\mu)^{2}f(x)\,dx =\int_{\mathbb {R} }x^{2}\,dF(x)-\mu^{2},$$

or equivalently,

$$ Var(X)=\int_{\mathbb {R} }x^{2}f(x)\,dx-\mu^{2}$$
