This is followed by a rest periodthat can last four months.
Fang Hong is thinkingof an important matter.
[Fang Hong] Gaigai, come.There's a sheep for you to kill.
Bring your child in the afternoon for thegathering.
[sheep baaing]
[narrator] After the autumn harvesteach year, neighbors and friends
will have a special gathering.
Locals call it dapinghuo.
Today, it's Fang Hong's treat.
According to the practice,he'll provide one whole sheep.
The lamb just needs to be cooked simply.
The rest of the parts,such as sheep entrails,
requires more effort in handling.
In Gansu, different combinations and cooking techniques
make the sheep entrails very flavorful.
Stir-fry various sheep entrails withvegetables,
serve them on a warm plate, and eat them while it's hot.
SHANDAN STIR-FRIED BOLA
Use a small pot to stew them.
The sheep entrails soupis rich and thick.
It's most suitable for warmthduring winter.
LINXIA SMALL SHEEP ENTRAILS SOUP
Fry them on a hot plate,
the sheep intestinesare tender on the inside
and crispy on the outside.
Dipped in garlic sauce,it's very enjoyable.
ZHANGYE HOT PLATE FRIED BLOOD SAUSAGE
But today, Fang Hong's family will makea more special sheep entrails dish.
Mince the sheep's heart and lungs,add scallions and ginger to season,
and mix them repeatedly.
Then, pour fragrant flaxseed oil.
Place the thoroughly mixed fillinginto the sheep intestines.
Locals call them fazi.
This name came from a mode of traditional transportation
on the Yellow River:
Sheepskin raft.
Fresh sheep entrails are very flavorful.
They need to be cookedas soon as possible.
Poke holes to release excess air.
After cooking for an hour,the fazis are ready.
The rich flavor of various sheep entrailsare gathered together in the intestines.
Every juicy bite has a rich, chewy,and complex flavor.
Dapinghuo.
This "go dutch" approach in the villagecomes from frugal times.
Its core significanceis to evenly distribute food
That's also Fang Hong's last duty today.
Seven, eight, nine, ten… that's right.Come and eat.
[narrator] Nowadays, dapinghuo has becomea common social gathering in the village.
In the backyard of an ordinary household,people sit and gather together
because of delicious food.
FAZI
As Linxia's specialty snack,there's a more intricate way
of making fazi in the city.
Here, it has a pleasing partner.
Mix flour and waterin a two to three ratio,
and season it simply.
The clean and delicate small intestineis formed.
Fazi is rough,while the flour intestines are dense
When they collide,their tastes complement each other.
FAZI INTESTINE NOODLES
People in Gansu are goodat making staple food.
There are many combinationssimilar to fazi flour intestines.
Hundreds of combinations existfor grains and meats,
creating all kinds of rice dishes.
Delicious and satisfying.
LINXIA HEYAN NOODLES
HEZHOU BUNS
Gansu is composedof various complex terrains.
From Linxia,travel 700 kilometers north
and reach the grasslandsin the Hexi Corridor.
The Yugu tribe herders here
have a different experiencein handling sheep entrails.
At their summer pasture residence in the Qilian Mountain,
Mu Rong and her husband are makingshaokezi.
That is their daily staple food.
Today, her younger brother and his familyreturn from the city.
[Mu Rong] Long time, no see.
[narrator] Shaokezi is just an appetizer.
The kids miss a unique dishmade from sheep entrails.
Five-year-old Tibetan sheepaccumulates more flavor in its body.
Among sheep's entrails,herders prioritize sheep liver more.
They have a unique way of handling it.
Clear and transparent,with webbed patterns like lace,
that's a fatty membranein the sheep's stomach.
It's called caul fat.
As it's rich in fats upon removal,it oxidates and spoils very fast.
Mu Rong needs to handle it quickly.
With sheep liver as filling,and caul fat as the covering,
these two sheep entrails transformin the hands of herders,
and are reborn.
The technique of using caul fatto wrap food
already has 3,000 years of historyin China.
For hundreds of years, the ancestorsof the Yugu tribe constantly migrated
in the Qilian Mountain region.
In the end, they settled here.
Based on their food, we can see tracesof how they lived before.
The caul fat tightly covers its filling.
The fats melt from the heatand penetrate into the sheep liver.
These two flavors complementand fuse together.
Slicing and frying themreleases the flavor again.
It's even richer and sweeter.
It's twilight.
The rich aroma floats in the valley.
This kind of food traversedin the nomadic times,
and its flavor never diminished.
-[woman laughing]-[indistict Mandarin]
In the language of the Yugu tribe,it has a simple and elegant name:
Fat-wrapped liver.
