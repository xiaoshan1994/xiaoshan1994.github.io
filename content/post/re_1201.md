* Microplastics are solid plastic particles composed of polymers and functional additives less than 5 millimetres in size.
* Already, microplastics have been found in almost all marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems as well as in food and drinking water.
* Current bans mainly focus on the application of scrubbing microbeads in cosmetics. These beads are rinsed off after use and migrate to sewage treatment plants and surface waters.

# Bioplastics--alternatives to fossil-based plastics
* Recently, a stronger EU regulatory focus on the different stages of the plastic lifecycle and a growing public scrutiny regarding plastic waste.
* Current regulations covering plastics are not consistent or suited to the specifics of bioplastics.
