# What are microplastics?

* Microplastics are solid plastic particles composed of polymers and functional additives less than 5 millimetres in size.
* Already, microplastics have been found in almost all marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems as well as in food and drinking water.
* Current bans mainly focus on the application of scrubbing microbeads in cosmetics. These beads are rinsed off after use and migrate to sewage treatment plants and surface waters.

# Bioplastics--alternatives to fossil-based plastics
* Recently, a stronger EU regulatory focus on the different stages of the plastic lifecycle and a growing public scrutiny regarding plastic waste.
* Current regulations covering plastics are not consistent or suited to the specifics of bioplastics.

*  Each year, at least 8 million tonnes of plastics leak into the ocean â€“
which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute.
* Scale up the adoption of {{< hl-text blue>}}industrially compostable plastic packaging{{< /hl-text >}} for targeted applications such as garbage bags for organic waste and food packaging for events.
* Drastically reduce the leakage of plastics into natural systems and other negative externalities.
* The plastics industry as a whole is highly reliant on finite stocks of {{< hl-text blue>}}oil{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}gas{{< /hl-text >}}, which make up more than 90% of its feedstock.

* The {{< hl-text blue>}}externalities{{< /hl-text >}} related to the use of plastics and plastic packaging are concentrated in three areas: {{< hl-text orange>}}degradation of natural systems as a result of {{< hl-text blue>}}leakage{{< /hl-text >}}, especially in the ocean;{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}GHG resulting from {{< hl-text blue>}}production{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}after-use incineration{{< /hl-text >}};{{< /hl-text >}} and health and environmental impacts from substances of concern.

*  An LCA optimisation by each individual actor does not necessarily lead to better system outcomes (while it is well suited to evaluate individual choices today, it is less suitable for determining the target state towards which a system as a whole could innovate).
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Another drawback is considering only carbon, leaving behind the effects of leakage into the natural environment. {{< /hl-text >}}
