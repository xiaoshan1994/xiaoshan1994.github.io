# REPAIR project
http://h2020repair.eu/
A geodesign decision support environment (GDSE) analysing metabolic flows and urban processes within Europe.

# Assessingthe Transition of Municipal Solid Waste Management Using Combined Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment
* municipal solid waste (MSW).
* Three historical situations in  2001/02, 2006/07  and  2016/17 cor-responding  to three  transitional  stages  in  Nottingham in  response to  the  EU  waste directives were investigated and assessed.
* MFA is perfromed by STAN v2.6 (http://stan2web.net/).
* MSW was conceptualized as household waste which ncludes all  waste collected from  household sources and street cleaning.
* Separately collected commercial waste, industrial waste and healthcare waste were excluded from the scope of assessment.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Functional unit of LCA{{< hl-text blue>}} was defined as {{< hl-text orange>}}the treatment of one ton of MSW{{< hl-text blue>}}, to ensure the situations were comparable to each other.
* The MSW management processes include waste generation, collection, transfer,
transport, treatment and disposal.
