## Introduction
* Municipal solid waste (MSW).
* Refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
* Three historical situations in  2001/02, 2006/07  and  2016/17 cor-responding  to three  transitional  stages  in  Nottingham in  response to  the  EU  waste directives were investigated and assessed.
* MFA is perfromed by STAN v2.6 (http://stan2web.net/).
* MSW was conceptualized as household waste which ncludes all  waste collected from  household sources and street cleaning.
* Separately collected commercial waste, industrial waste and healthcare waste were excluded from the scope of assessment.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Functional unit of LCA{{< /hl-text >}} was defined as {{< hl-text orange>}}the treatment of one ton of MSW{{< /hl-text >}}, to ensure the situations were comparable to each other.
* The MSW management processes include waste generation, collection, transfer,
transport, treatment and disposal.
* Considering heat recovered MSW returns to home heating.
* Different emission factors of electricity in three years.

## Life Cycle Inventory

* GHG emission factor for each vehicle type was taken from Ecoinvent v3 database.
* {{< hl-text orange>}}Distances travelled in kerbside collection, bulky waste collection and door-to-door collection{{< hl-text blue>}} were modelled based on {{< hl-text blue>}}the length of accessible street{{< /hl-text >}} within Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) Google Earth, {{< hl-text blue>}}the average population within LSOA{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}MSW generation per capita{{< /hl-text >}} in Nottingham.
* Electricity and diesel consumed for the operation of transfer
station were 4 kWh/t and 0.84 kg/t, respectively.
* Distances between LSOA and waste management facilities and distances between facilities were estimated based on their locations using Google Earth and Google map.

* For **landfill**, diesel and electricity consumptions for the operation of landfill were 1.8 kg/t and 8 kWh/t, respectively.

* For **incineration** and **energy recovery**:

Electricity and fuel oil consumed to operate incineration plant were 62 kWh/t and 3.76 kg/t, respectively.
* The **recycling** part refer to an England-based report, which compares GHG avoided by material recycling and landfilling.
* For **composting**, 36% of garden waste was assumed to be non-compostable material.
* **Material recovery facility**. Consiering diesel and electricity consumption for two facilities in Nottingham.
* GHG emission from the incineration of RDF could be calculated based on the mass and fossil carbon content of RDF.
