# Highlights

* EU citizens have a plastic footprint of between 84 and 129 kg per capita per year.
* The packaging sector and three polymers (LDPE, PP and PET) dominate plastic flows.
* Plastic footprint estimates are compared based on literature data and consumption statistics.
* Estimates of littering potential per product are provided based on beach litter data.
* Plastic footprint and littering potential data are key for EU policy prioritization of intervention.

## 1.1. Approaches for quantifying plastic flows
* However, no standard methodology to measure the extent of the plastic problem is yet available.
* A review of approaches highlighted a predominance of methodologies focusing on the assessment of plastic usage, waste or recycling rates, {{< hl-text orange>}}with little focus on circularity (Boucher et al., 2019).{{< /hl-text >}}
* Literature assessed plastic flows and stock adopting MFA or PMFA (probabilistic MFA): [Sustainable cycles and management of plastics: a brief review of RCR publications in 2019 and early 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920301439?via%3Dihub); [at global level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344919303659?via%3Dihub); [for EU](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b01513); at country level: [Switzerland](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b02900), [Austria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344916302956?via%3Dihub[^]:), [Denmark](https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2019/06/978-87-7038-082-9.pdf) and [Finland](http://arvifinalreport.fi/files/Material%20flow%20analysis%20of%20plastic%20for%20Finland%20160117.pdf), [India (December 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344905001588?via%3Dihub), [China (November 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344919304902?via%3Dihub), [Trinidad and Tobago](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344919303313?via%3Dihub); [the newest one for EU28 (December 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666789420300040?via%3Dihub); [an EN report supporting Circular Plastic Alliance goal of 10 million tonnes (November 2020)](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC122453)

## 1.2. Scope and objectives

This paper aims at modelling the plastic footprint of EU for {{< hl-text blue>}}2014{{< /hl-text >}} and addresses {{< hl-text blue>}}the likelihood of plastic to become marine litter{{< /hl-text >}}

# 2. Materials and methods

This study is structured in three main steps：(a) literature-based EU plastic footprint (Section 2.1), (b) consumption statistics-based EU plastic footprint (i.e., derived from consumption statistics; Eurostat, 2020a) (Section 2.2), and (c) calculation of marine litter likelihood based on the EU beach litter database (Addamo et al., 2018; Hanke et al., 2019) (Section 2.3). Fig. 1 distinguishes these three steps by colours and illustrates their various interlinkages.

### 2.1.3. Plastic flow database

* Based on {{< hl-text blue>}}11 reference studies{{< /hl-text >}}.
* data on {{< hl-text blue>}}healthcare sector{{< /hl-text >}} is added, including syringes, disposal gloves and infusion bags.
* complement data on {{< hl-text blue>}}fishing sector{{< /hl-text >}} calculating with various polymer content ratios.

### 2.1.4. Literature-based EU plastic footprint

Assuming that the percentage of one country's {{< hl-text blue>}}plastic footprint{{< /hl-text >}} in a specific year on EU in 2004 is in direct proportion to the percentage of its {{< hl-text blue>}}GDP{{< /hl-text >}} of that year on EU 2004.

## 2.2. Consumption statistics-based EU plastic footprint

Plastic footprint equals product consumption multiplied by plastic content share after transferring to mass units and allocating to different economic sectors as its share.

## 2.3. Assessment of marine litter potential
