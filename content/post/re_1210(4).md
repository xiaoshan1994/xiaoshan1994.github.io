# Highlights
* Framework for including {{< hl-text orange>}}{{< hl-text blue>}}plastic litter impacts{{< /hl-text >}} in life cycle impact assessment.{{< /hl-text >}}
* Impact pathways from plastic litter sources to damage on six Areas of Protection.
* Includes consideration of both existing and new impact categories.
* To foster development of characterisation factors for marine plastic litter impacts.

# Results and conclusions
The proposed framework links inventory data in terms of kg plastic leaked to a specified environmental compartment (air, terrestrial, freshwater, marine) to six AoPs (Areas of Protection): {{< hl-text blue>}}ecosystem quality, human health, socio-economic assets, ecosystem services, natural heritage and cultural heritage.{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}The fate modelling step, which includes {{< hl-text blue>}}transportation, fragmentation and degradation processes,{{< /hl-text >}} is common to all included impact pathways.{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text orange>}}Exposure and effect modelling steps differentiate between at least six exposure pathways,{{< /hl-text >}} {{< hl-text blue>}}e.g. inhalation, ingestion, entanglement, invasive species rafting, accumulation, and smothering, that potentially compromise sensitive receptors, such as ecosystems, humans, and manmade structures.{{< /hl-text >}} The framework includes both {{< hl-text blue>}}existing, e.g. human toxicity and ecotoxicity,{{< /hl-text >}} and proposed {{< hl-text blue>}}new impact categories,{{< /hl-text >}} e.g. {{< hl-text blue>}}physical effect on biota{{< /hl-text >}}, and can be used as a basis for coordinating harmonized research efforts.
