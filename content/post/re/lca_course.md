2122-S1 LCA Practice & Reporting - Theory Week: Lectures
# 1. Introduction LCA-PR

**Overall aim**: provide sufficient scientific basis and practical skills to perform an attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) study.

• Draft a concise, to-the-point proposal for their own LCA research including a brief
literature review
• Perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA study
• Develop a proper LCA model in CMLCA
• Present results, identify problems and propose solutions
• Plan and monitor research
• Report an LCA study and its findings transparently and comprehensively
• Identify, justify and report LCA's key methodological assumptions and choices
• Critically evaluate and discuss the possibilities and constraints of their LCA study.

**Assignment 1: Research proposal**

Proposals should demonstrate the {{< hl-text blue>}}environmental relevance{{< /hl-text >}} of the chosen case study with existing literature as well as provide {{< hl-text blue>}}justification{{< /hl-text >}} for the use of LCA in their specific applications. The goal of the research proposal is for students to formulate the research question (including a hot spot analysis), identify challenges and make a work plan.

## Research proposal requirements and guidelines

As preparation for drafting the research proposal, students are required to read the article by Hengl and Gould (2002): https://www.itc.nl/library/papers/hengl_rules.pdf. Proposals are graded according to how well the student follows the requirements below.

## Format and submission requirements:
• Proposals must be submitted through Brightspace (Leiden) / Assignments (use the similarity check to resolve any outstanding issues prior to the due date).
• Max. 2000 words including a maximum 300 words abstract, Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices.

## Content requirements:
• **Title** and **student name**
• **Abstract** (300 words): Define the research question(s), propose an LCA case study, describe the scope and discuss your approach. Tell us why the case study is important and why a life cycle approach is necessary. The abstract at this point should make your audience want to know more about your study without necessarily having the final results.
• **Introduction** (problem statement, literature review, research question, …. ): Include background information, previous research on the topic (including LCA literature). Here, you will use existing literature (at least 2 reference LCA studies) to construct the problem statement and identify a knowledge gap. For example, “all studies so far focus on the comparative advantages at the use phase, while neglecting manufacturing and processing which may not compensate for gains in efficiency. This study takes a life cycle approach to evaluate the systemic environmental implications of A and B and determine if there is an environmental advantage to either one. Moreover, hot spots are identified for both alternatives”.
• **Goal and Scope Definition**: Under goal definition include a brief discussion on goal, intended application of your study, researcher, commissioner, target audience, steeringcie, expert reviewer. Under scope definition include a brief discussion on ALCA/CLCA, detailed LCA, temporal/geographical/technology coverage, coverage of processes and of interventions and impacts. Finally, discuss function, FU, alternatives, and reference flows.
• **Flowcharts**: Preliminary flowcharts following the conventions learned during the Theory week (no copy from literature). One flow chart per alternative.
• **Method**: This section outlines how you will proceed with your LCA. This includes data collection (identified data sources), impact assessment families applied, recycling, and allocation.
• **Fulfillment of model requirements** (pg. 8). Discuss how you will meet the model requirements (see below under assignment 3).
• **Discussion**: Identify possible difficulties and their solutions. This is an opportunity to identify areas that may be challenging. Along with the challenges, try to propose a solution (even if it is too early) as you can get feedback on how you plan to proceed.
• **Planning**: Provide a schedule for the work plan. This should include all phases of LCA as presented during the Theory Week as well as the milestones (assignments) and possible periods that you will not be able to work on your case study.
• **References**: Use the format of the Journal of Industrial Ecology (Harvard style) to organize your references (https://jie.yale.edu/jie-style-guide-accepted-manuscripts) and/or use a reference manager using the correct (JIE) export settings or Word import settings. Include relevant and sufficient

## Advice
Use the theory week to think, talk and discuss your ideas with the group;
Use the terminology you learned during the theory week (glossary);
Time is limited, focus on the course requirements and don’t set your additional requirements too high. For example, leave the “Life Cycle Stage contribution analysis” for the end.
While waiting for our feedback you can already start doing your research, use all the time you have.

## **Assignment 2: Presentation**
## **Assignment 3: Final report**
For the LCA-PR course the student is expected to perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA case study based on what has been taught during the Theory Week. The student needs to submit a properly structured and type-written report, along with the CMLCA-file (‘model’) that is created for the LCA study. Through the report and the CMLCA-file, the student should convince the course instructors that (s)he understands the LCA theory, how to apply the theory in practice in a case study, and how to interpret an LCA study’s results taking into account the proper use and constraints of LCA.

The results of the case study performed during the course cannot generally classify as a full LCA. Instead, this is more of an educational exercise. Please have this in mind when performing your case study.

## **Model requirements (Mandatory!):**

In addition to the use of the background ecoinvent v3.4 database, the student should model (in CMLCA) at least 5 foreground unit processes including:

• 1 disposal process (modelling waste flows out and not waste services (as goods) in!)[^in]
• 1 closed-loop (reuse or closed-loop recycling);
• 1 multifunctional co-production process (not open-loop recycling, but co-production process!) (explicitly reporting on all 4 steps as learned during the Theory Week; see last slide of the Allocation presentation); applying two ways (of which one may be a sensitivity analysis) of allocation including economic allocation[^ec];
• 1 unit process with at least 3 environmental emissions (extensions) calculated by the student[^3ex]. Note that directly gathering values from literature does not count;
• at least (!) 1 additional unit process free of choice.

The closed loop process also needs allocation but this does NOT count as the multifunctional process at the same time, so you need to model these two processes separately.

Next to the modeling the work should also include a comparison of (at least) two product alternatives, a full impact assessment (not just a couple of impact categories) selecting two families (at least the PEF as baseline, and the CML or ReCiPe family as sensitivity analysis), at least two types of contribution analysis (applying the built-in functions of CMLCA, e.g., at the level of process contributions to category indicator results and at the level of process-emissions contributing to category indicator results for all impact categories, optionally grouping processes manually into stages (which is not the same as a contribution analysis by life cycle stage (LCS or ‘big ship’ analysis), etc.; applying the LCS (or ‘big ship’) contribution analysis is optional, not (!!) mandatory but can deliver extra points when properly performed) and several sensitivity analyses (at least three: one on allocation (see above), one on characterization families (see above); and one free choice, preferably based and justified by your contribution analysis results). Finally, the student should report in a short table how these model requirements have been dealt with in the report.

## Reporting
Students should use the mandatory report lay-out presented below. Next to that the ISO 14040 guidelines should be followed to report the LCA work done. Additional guidance on reporting can be found in the Handbook on LCA, which includes elaborated reporting guidelines on the basis of these ISO reporting guidelines. It is strongly recommended to use the Handbook for this. The abstract should not exceed 300 words. The main report should not exceed 6000 words (no range; 6000 is the limit), including Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices. but excluding references and supporting information. Any text beyond 6000 words will not be taken into account for grading, although appendix/appendices may be provided in which the student provides supporting information (no page limit). Don’t forget to insert page numbers in your report! Data reporting is crucial! Students should use the CMLCA unit process data format to present the data for their foreground processes, and in the main report and appendices (supporting information) they should clearly document how they got from the raw literature/internet data to the eventual unit process data implemented in their CMLCA file, including all assumptions, calculations and sources used.

Finally, you need to carefully think what to put in the main report with the word limit, and what to put in Appendices. You cannot "outsource" important information to the annexes. All important information needs to be in the main text, and appendices should be made for the inventory table, classification tables and further detailing of information (e.g., of process data) included in the main report. Teachers should be basically able to understand your case study, assumptions, data, results etc. by reading the main report only.

## Mandatory report lay-out

All points below should be addressed in your final report. You can add other topics (for example, contribution analysis by life cycle phase and/or uncertainty analysis) but these need to be covered at the correct location in your report according to the ISO14040 structure and the LCA Handbook. Instructions on how to describe specific topics can be found in the LCA Handbook.

# 2. LCA-PR_History_of_LCA
[Life Cycle Assessment: Past, Present, and Future](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es101316v)

Environ. Sci. Technol. September 2, 2010
* The study of environmental impacts of consumer products has a history that dates back to the 1960s and 1970s. Especially in a comparative context (“Is product A better than product B?”).
## The Past of LCA (1970−2000)
1970−1990: Decades of Conception

* One of the first (unfortunately unpublished) studies quantifying the resource requirements, emission loadings, and waste flows of different beverage containers was conducted by Midwest Research Institute (MRI) for the Coca Cola Company in 1969.
* During the 1970s and the 1980s LCAs were performed using different methods and without a common theoretical framework. LCA was repeatedly applied by firms to substantiate market claims.

1990−2000: Decade of Standardization
* The period of 1990−2000 can therefore be characterized as a period of convergence through SETAC’s coordination (“Code of Practice”) and ISO’s standardization activities (1994)
* A key result of ISO’s standardization work has been the definition of a general methodological framework.

## The Present of LCA: Decade of Elaboration
Diverging approaches have been developed with respect to system boundaries and allocation methods, dynamic LCA, spatially differentiated LCA, risk-based LCA, and environmental input-output based LCA (EIO-LCA) and hybrid LCA (69-71) that may have a tense relation with some of the basic principles of the ISO standards.

## 3.1 Glossary
From LCA Handbook (Guinée et al. 2002).
This glossary provides definitions of the key terms and abbreviations used in the MSc-IE LCAPR course. The glossary is copied from the LCA Handbook (Guinée et al. 2002). Terms marked with an asterisk (\*) are defined in accordance with the definitions given in the ISO 1404X series of standards, although not necessarily according to the letter. For reasons explained in the LCA Handbook, several definitions adopted here deviate substantively from those of ISO. In this Glossary these are marked as "adapted from ISO". Cross-references,
indicated by an arrow (→), point to the preferred terms used in the LCA Handbook.

the interface between a product system and the environment system or other product systems.
**third party \***
a critical reviewer or a stakeholder other than the LCA commissioner or practitioner.
**transparency \***
open, comprehensive and understandable presentation of information.
**unit process \***
{{< hl-text orange>}}the smallest portion of a product system for which data are collected in an LCA{{< /hl-text >}}.
**use process**
{{< hl-text orange>}}a unit process in which the final product is consumed, thereby delivering the function under study. {{< /hl-text >}}
**waste (for treatment)**
An economic flow with a zero or negative value produced in a unit process and serving as an input to another unit process ({{< hl-text orange>}}note: materials such as waste paper and scrap metals with a positive economic, i.e. market value are thus not wastes but products{{< /hl-text >}}) (adapted from ISO).
**weighting \***
a step of Impact assessment in which the (normalised) indicator results for each impact category assessed are assigned numerical factors according to their relative importance, multiplied by these factors and possibly aggregated; {{< hl-text orange>}}weighting is based on value-choices (e.g. monetary values, standards, expert panel). {{< /hl-text >}}
**weighting factor**
a factor obtained with a weighting method and used to express a particular (normalised) indicator result in terms of the common unit of the weighting result.
**weighting profile \***
the result of the weighting step: a table showing all the weighting results, supplemented by any other relevant information.
**weighting result**
the numerical part of the result of weighting and aggregation of all (normalised) indicator results, e.g. 0.08 yr (note: the result may be expressed as more than one numerical value)

**Foreground system/process**: a system or process for which {{< hl-text blue>}}primary, site-specific data{{< /hl-text >}} are used in an LCA, for whatever reason.

**Background system/process**: a system or process for which {{< hl-text blue>}}secondary data{{< /hl-text >}}, viz. databases, public references, estimated data based on input-output analysis, are used in an LCA.

**Background processes**: can also be depicted with arrows only (thus no boxes); the advantage is that diagrams get less cluttered; the disadvantage that the information on the producing activity is lost; the choice is yours; you do not need to report all inputs from background processes, but only those that are important for your system.

**Environmental flows?**: While these are part of unit processes, they are typically not shown in flowcharts.

**Fore- vs. Background systems**: FG is what you model yourself (also when you adapt background processes); background processes are “untouched” from an LCI database untouched” from an LCI database.

**Cut-offs**: flows that are not considered in your system are described by entering or leaving the system boundaries. In addition to cut cut-offs also reference flows and co-products will leave the SB.

**Multifunctionality**: how co-products are dealt with does not need to be described at the level of the flowchart ( e.g. system expansion vs. allocation), but it is good to indicate such processes.

**multifunctional process**
a unit process yielding more than one functional flow, e.g. co-production, combined waste processing, recycling.

**multifunctionality and allocation \***
{{< hl-text orange>}}a step of the Inventory analysis in which the inventory model is refined and the input and output flows of multifunctional processes are partitioned to the functional flows of those processes. {{< /hl-text >}}

[^in]: There are basically 2 options for modelling your own disposal process: 1) connecting a waste flow out to an ecoinvent waste process (and accepting its data); 2) defining a new disposal process managing your specific waste, calculating 3 emissions yourself applying chemical reactions and mass balancing (IN=OUT) fulfilling the “3 emissions calculation requirement” below, and optionally copying data on economic inflows like electricity and fuel needs from an existing similar ecoinvent process.
[^ec]: You cannot use the same process to fulfill the closed loop and the multifunctionality co-production requirements; you need separate processes for that. Closed loop also involves a multifunctional problem, but the solutions (either allocation or substitution) don’t change the results as will be/has been discussed in class. Therefore, you are also required to model a co-production process with at least one functional flow crossing the system boundary.
[^3ex]: Three extensions should be calculated yourself, not taking them from literature. The idea behind this requirement is that you calculate, e.g., some emission values yourself from just looking at the composition of an economic flow and making mass balances. For example, the incineration of a product containing C, S and Cd will lead to emissions of CO, CO2, SO2 and Cd that can be estimated using assumptions from literature and applying mass balance principles and chemical reaction equations.
