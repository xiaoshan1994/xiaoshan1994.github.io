2122-S1 LCA Practice & Reporting - Theory Week: Lectures
# 1. Introduction LCA-PR

**Overall aim**: provide sufficient scientific basis and practical skills to perform an attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) study.

• Draft a concise, to-the-point proposal for their own LCA research including a brief
literature review
• Perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA study
• Develop a proper LCA model in CMLCA
• Present results, identify problems and propose solutions
• Plan and monitor research
• Report an LCA study and its findings transparently and comprehensively
• Identify, justify and report LCA's key methodological assumptions and choices
• Critically evaluate and discuss the possibilities and constraints of their LCA study.

**Assignment 1: Research proposal**

Proposals should demonstrate the {{< hl-text blue>}}environmental relevance{{< /hl-text >}} of the chosen case study with existing literature as well as provide {{< hl-text blue>}}justification{{< /hl-text >}} for the use of LCA in their specific applications. The goal of the research proposal is for students to formulate the research question (including a hot spot analysis), identify challenges and make a work plan.

## Research proposal requirements and guidelines

As preparation for drafting the research proposal, students are required to read the article by Hengl and Gould (2002): https://www.itc.nl/library/papers/hengl_rules.pdf. Proposals are graded according to how well the student follows the requirements below.

## Format and submission requirements
• Proposals must be submitted through Brightspace (Leiden) / Assignments (use the similarity check to resolve any outstanding issues prior to the due date).
• Max. 2000 words including a maximum 300 words abstract, Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices.

## Content requirements
• **Title** and **student name**
• **Abstract** (300 words): Define the research question(s), propose an LCA case study, describe the scope and discuss your approach. Tell us why the case study is important and why a life cycle approach is necessary. The abstract at this point should make your audience want to know more about your study without necessarily having the final results.
• **Introduction** (problem statement, literature review, research question, …. ): Include background information, previous research on the topic (including LCA literature). Here, you will use existing literature (at least 2 reference LCA studies) to construct the problem statement and identify a knowledge gap. For example, “all studies so far focus on the comparative advantages at the use phase, while neglecting manufacturing and processing which may not compensate for gains in efficiency. This study takes a life cycle approach to evaluate the systemic environmental implications of A and B and determine if there is an environmental advantage to either one. Moreover, hot spots are identified for both alternatives”.
• **Goal and Scope Definition**: Under goal definition include a brief discussion on goal, intended application of your study, researcher, commissioner, target audience, steeringcie, expert reviewer. Under scope definition include a brief discussion on ALCA/CLCA, detailed LCA, temporal/geographical/technology coverage, coverage of processes and of interventions and impacts. Finally, discuss function, FU, alternatives, and reference flows.
• **Flowcharts**: Preliminary flowcharts following the conventions learned during the Theory week (no copy from literature). One flow chart per alternative.
• **Method**: This section outlines how you will proceed with your LCA. This includes data collection (identified data sources), impact assessment families applied, recycling, and allocation.
• **Fulfillment of model requirements** (pg. 8). Discuss how you will meet the model requirements (see below under assignment 3).
• **Discussion**: Identify possible difficulties and their solutions. This is an opportunity to identify areas that may be challenging. Along with the challenges, try to propose a solution (even if it is too early) as you can get feedback on how you plan to proceed.
• **Planning**: Provide a schedule for the work plan. This should include all phases of LCA as presented during the Theory Week as well as the milestones (assignments) and possible periods that you will not be able to work on your case study.
• **References**: Use the format of the Journal of Industrial Ecology (Harvard style) to organize your references (https://jie.yale.edu/jie-style-guide-accepted-manuscripts) and/or use a reference manager using the correct (JIE) export settings or Word import settings. Include relevant and sufficient

## Advice
Use the theory week to think, talk and discuss your ideas with the group;
Use the terminology you learned during the theory week (glossary);
Time is limited, focus on the course requirements and don’t set your additional requirements too high. For example, leave the “Life Cycle Stage contribution analysis” for the end.
While waiting for our feedback you can already start doing your research, use all the time you have.

## Assignment 2: Presentation
## Assignment 3: Final report
For the LCA-PR course the student is expected to perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA case study based on what has been taught during the Theory Week. The student needs to submit a properly structured and type-written report, along with the CMLCA-file (‘model’) that is created for the LCA study. Through the report and the CMLCA-file, the student should convince the course instructors that (s)he understands the LCA theory, how to apply the theory in practice in a case study, and how to interpret an LCA study’s results taking into account the proper use and constraints of LCA.

The results of the case study performed during the course cannot generally classify as a full LCA. Instead, this is more of an educational exercise. Please have this in mind when performing your case study.

## Model requirements (Mandatory!)

In addition to the use of the background ecoinvent v3.4 database, the student should model (in CMLCA) at least 5 foreground unit processes including:

• 1 disposal process (modelling waste flows out and not waste services (as goods) in!)[^in]
• 1 closed-loop (reuse or closed-loop recycling);
• 1 multifunctional co-production process (not open-loop recycling, but co-production process!) (explicitly reporting on all 4 steps as learned during the Theory Week; see last slide of the Allocation presentation); applying two ways (of which one may be a sensitivity analysis) of allocation including economic allocation[^ec];
• 1 unit process with at least 3 environmental emissions (extensions) calculated by the student[^3ex]. Note that directly gathering values from literature does not count;
• at least (!) 1 additional unit process free of choice.

The closed loop process also needs allocation but this does NOT count as the multifunctional process at the same time, so you need to model these two processes separately.

Next to the modeling the work should also include a comparison of (at least) two product alternatives, a full impact assessment (not just a couple of impact categories) selecting two families (at least the PEF as baseline, and the CML or ReCiPe family as sensitivity analysis), at least two types of contribution analysis (applying the built-in functions of CMLCA, e.g., at the level of process contributions to category indicator results and at the level of process-emissions contributing to category indicator results for all impact categories, optionally grouping processes manually into stages (which is not the same as a contribution analysis by life cycle stage (LCS or ‘big ship’ analysis), etc.; applying the LCS (or ‘big ship’) contribution analysis is optional, not (!!) mandatory but can deliver extra points when properly performed) and several sensitivity analyses (at least three: one on allocation (see above), one on characterization families (see above); and one free choice, preferably based and justified by your contribution analysis results). Finally, the student should report in a short table how these model requirements have been dealt with in the report.

## Reporting
Students should use the mandatory report lay-out presented below. Next to that the ISO 14040 guidelines should be followed to report the LCA work done. Additional guidance on reporting can be found in the Handbook on LCA, which includes elaborated reporting guidelines on the basis of these ISO reporting guidelines. It is strongly recommended to use the Handbook for this. The abstract should not exceed 300 words. The main report should not exceed 6000 words (no range; 6000 is the limit), including Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices. but excluding references and supporting information. Any text beyond 6000 words will not be taken into account for grading, although appendix/appendices may be provided in which the student provides supporting information (no page limit). Don’t forget to insert page numbers in your report! Data reporting is crucial! Students should use the CMLCA unit process data format to present the data for their foreground processes, and in the main report and appendices (supporting information) they should clearly document how they got from the raw literature/internet data to the eventual unit process data implemented in their CMLCA file, including all assumptions, calculations and sources used.

Finally, you need to carefully think what to put in the main report with the word limit, and what to put in Appendices. You cannot "outsource" important information to the annexes. All important information needs to be in the main text, and appendices should be made for the inventory table, classification tables and further detailing of information (e.g., of process data) included in the main report. Teachers should be basically able to understand your case study, assumptions, data, results etc. by reading the main report only.

## Mandatory report lay-out

All points below should be addressed in your final report. You can add other topics (for example, contribution analysis by life cycle phase and/or uncertainty analysis) but these need to be covered at the correct location in your report according to the ISO14040 structure and the LCA Handbook. Instructions on how to describe specific topics can be found in the LCA Handbook.

# 2. History of LCA
[Life Cycle Assessment: Past, Present, and Future](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es101316v)
Jeroen B. Guinée
Environ. Sci. Technol. September 2, 2010
* The study of environmental impacts of consumer products has a history that dates back to the 1960s and 1970s. Especially in a comparative context (“Is product A better than product B?”).

## 2.1 The Past of LCA (1970−2000)
1970−1990: Decades of Conception

* One of the first (unfortunately unpublished) studies quantifying the resource requirements, emission loadings, and waste flows of different beverage containers was conducted by Midwest Research Institute (MRI) for the Coca Cola Company in 1969.
* During the 1970s and the 1980s LCAs were performed using different methods and without a common theoretical framework. LCA was repeatedly applied by firms to substantiate market claims.

1990−2000: Decade of Standardization
* The period of 1990−2000 can therefore be characterized as a period of convergence through SETAC’s coordination (“Code of Practice”) and ISO’s standardization activities (1994)
* A key result of ISO’s standardization work has been the definition of a general methodological framework.

## 2.2 The Present of LCA: Decade of Elaboration
Diverging approaches have been developed with respect to system boundaries and allocation methods, dynamic LCA, spatially differentiated LCA, risk-based LCA, and environmental input-output based LCA (EIO-LCA) and hybrid LCA (69-71) that may have a tense relation with some of the basic principles of the ISO standards.

**Flow diagram**: a graphic representation of the interlinked unit processes comprising {{< hl-text blue>}}the product system{{< /hl-text >}}.

**Foreground system/process**: a system or process for which {{< hl-text blue>}}primary, site-specific data{{< /hl-text >}} are used in an LCA, for whatever reason.

**Background system/process**: a system or process for which {{< hl-text blue>}}secondary data{{< /hl-text >}}, viz. databases, public references, estimated data based on input-output analysis, are used in an LCA.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Background processes{{< /hl-text >}}**: can also be depicted with arrows only (thus no boxes); the advantage is that diagrams get less cluttered; the disadvantage that the information on the producing activity is lost; the choice is yours; {{< hl-text blue>}}you do not need to report all inputs from background processes, but only those that are important for your system{{< /hl-text >}}.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Fore- vs. Background systems{{< /hl-text >}}**: FG is what you model yourself (also when you adapt background processes); background processes are {{< hl-text blue>}}“untouched” from an LCI database{{< /hl-text >}}.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Environmental flows{{< /hl-text >}}**: While these are part of unit processes, they are typically not shown in flowcharts.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Cut-offs{{< /hl-text >}}**: flows that are not considered in your system are described by entering or leaving the system boundaries. In addition to {{< hl-text blue>}}cut-offs{{< /hl-text >}} also {{< hl-text blue>}}reference flows{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}co-products{{< /hl-text >}} will leave the SB.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Multifunctionality{{< /hl-text >}}**: how co-products are dealt with does not need to be described at the level of the flowchart ( e.g. system expansion vs. allocation), but it is good to indicate such processes.

**multifunctional process**: a unit process yielding more than one functional flow, e.g. co-production, combined waste processing, recycling.

**multifunctionality and allocation \***: a step of the Inventory analysis in which the inventory model is refined and the input and output flows of multifunctional processes are partitioned to the functional flows of those processes.

# 4. Goal and Scope Definition
## 4.1 ISO, GSD definition, and ALCA vs.CLCA
**LCA: ISO definition**
Compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle.

* Unresolved discussion on 2 modes of LCA:
  - attributional LCA (ALCA); impacts of current demand as it is (ceteris paribus) for the FU
  - consequential LCA (CLCA); impacts as consequence of a change in demand for the FU

* Attributional LCA (ALCA): to provide information on what portion of global burdens can be associated with a specific product life cycle.
* Consequential LCA (CLCA): to provide information on the environmental burdens that occur, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of a decision (usually represented by changes in demand for a product).
Source: Section 1.5.2 of “Global Guidance Principles for Life Cycle Assessment Databases” (UNEP 2011)

* CLCA differs in two ways from ALCA (Weidema, 2003):
  - co-product allocation is avoided by system expansion instead of applying allocation factors; and
  - included processes are those which are expected to be affected by a change in demand, i.e. processes supplying the marginal product instead of processes supplying the average products used in ALCA models.
[See also](https://consequential-lca.org/clca/marginal-suppliers/the-special-case-of-electricity/example-marginal-electricity-in-denmark/)

* Several other modes of LCA exist to model life-cycle impacts of possible future product systems (Guinée et al. 2018)

* ALCA & CLCA may show (highly) different results for the same
product system
  - reason: (scenario-)assumptions !!

> “[…] this article compares rapeseed oil and palm oil as a local and a global alternative for meeting the increasing demand for these products in the EU. By using detailed life cycle assessment (LCA), this study compares the environmental impacts and identifies alternative ways of producing rapeseed oil and palm oil to the EU market in order to reduce environmental impacts”. […] “Some, until recently, blind spots in agricultural LCAs are (1) the identification of the marginal/actually affected crops and regions, (2) the identification of how increased demand for an agricultural product is met and (3) avoided environmental interventions from transformation of non-productive land into agricultural land (Schmidt 2008a). Relating to (1), increased demand for rapeseed in the EU {{< hl-text blue>}}may{{< /hl-text >}} lead to either increased import or increased cultivation or a combination. {{< hl-text blue>}}If{{< /hl-text >}} cultivation is increased, it is important to clarify if this affects the area cultivated with other crops in the region. For example, in Denmark where the total agricultural area has been declining in the last decades, it is {{< hl-text blue>}}likely{{< /hl-text >}} that increased cultivation of rapeseed will cause less area available for other crops. Thus, the marginal crop will be displaced. {{< hl-text blue>}}If{{< /hl-text >}} it is {{< hl-text blue>}}assumed{{< /hl-text >}} that increased production of rapeseed does not affect the overall food security in the world, the displaced crop will be compensated for in the region representing the marginal supplier of that crop. Relating to (2), it is relevant to clarify {{< hl-text blue>}}if{{< /hl-text >}} increased agricultural production is met by increased yield or by increased area, i.e. transformation of non-productive land into agricultural land. This may include intermediate crop displacement; e.g. increased rapeseed in Denmark displaces barley; this ‘missing’ barley {{< hl-text blue>}}may{{< /hl-text >}} be produced in Canada either by intensification or by expanding the agricultural land.

> 4.1 Marginal suppliers of affected crops
...{{< hl-text blue>}}soybean meal{{< /hl-text >}} as the marginal source of {{< hl-text blue>}}fodder protein{{< /hl-text >}} and {{< hl-text blue>}}barley{{< /hl-text >}} as the marginal source of {{< hl-text blue>}}fodder energy{{< /hl-text >}}...
...the marginal suppliers of soybean meal and barley are Brazil and Canada, respectively.
...When soybean meal is displaced, the output of the dependant coproduct soybean oil is also affected. Market responses to that will most likely be {{< hl-text blue>}}a change in the production of the marginal vegetable oil{{< /hl-text >}}, i.e. palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia..
Carrying out the system expansion shows that {{< hl-text blue>}}increased demand for 1 t palm oil{{< /hl-text >}} requires production of 1.001 t palm oil and the displacement of 2.45 kg soybean meal and 198 kg barley. The additional 0.001 t PO equals the displaced soybean oil which is co-produced with the 2.45 kg displaced soy meal. Correspondingly, increased demand for 1 t rapeseed oil requires the production of the 1 t rapeseed oil and the displacement of 1.045 t soybean meal and 157 kg barley, {{< hl-text blue>}}whilst additional 255 kg palm oil is required{{< /hl-text >}}.

* However:
  - main body of knowledge (“95-99%”) is exactly the same for ALCA and CLCA;
  - our conviction that you can only learn and understand CLCA/ALCA if you first have good knowledge on LCA
  - there are many more (scenario-based) modes of LCA;
  - unclear as yet which questions are more appropriate for different modes of LCA;
  - there is no superior approach;
  - ……

A hypothetical example：
The {{< hl-text blue>}}goal{{< /hl-text >}} of the LCA is to {{< hl-text blue>}}identify options for improving{{< /hl-text >}} the environmental performance of the material polyethylene in throwaway bags for bread. The results of this LCA will be used for {{< hl-text blue>}}product and process development{{< /hl-text >}}. The plastic bag manufacturer wants to be able to analyse the effects of changes in their processes in terms of technology, inputs, and product composition on the total environmental impact. This information, in turn, can be used to prioritise different measures that can be taken to improve the environmental performance. This LCA does {{< hl-text blue>}}not aim at a public comparative assertion.{{< /hl-text >}}

The study is {{< hl-text blue>}}performed by{{< /hl-text >}} Pro-Duct Consultancy Ltd, a moderate-size private engineering bureau. The {{< hl-text blue>}}commissioner{{< /hl-text >}} is Bag-Away, a large producer of plastic throwaway bags. Interested parties are mainly plastics industry, bakeries and shops. A {{< hl-text blue>}}steering committee{{< /hl-text >}} with representatives from producer, ministry of environment and academia will be formed. Finally, an {{< hl-text blue>}}expert review{{< /hl-text >}} will be carried out at NILCAR, the National Institute for LCA Research.

Is LCA the right tool?
What are the environmental impacts of farming fish in Vietnam in the Mekong Delta?
- Risk Assessment rather than LCA …?
What are the environmental impacts related to consuming fish species x cultivated in Viet Nam compared to the same fish species x cultivated in Thailand?
- LCA rather than RA …?

## 4.3 Scope definition
* ALCA or CLCA (or LCA)?
* Detailed LCA?
* Temporal coverage
* Geographical coverage
* Technology coverage
* Coverage of processes
* Coverage of interventions and impacts

* Function, functional unit, alternatives and reference flows

* You should include these Scope elements in your case study report!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162566230-663047c5-1628-41f3-b823-6f1575476192.png)

* Detailed LCA (LCA Handbook, Part 3, p. 464-467):
  - This is not defined by ISO but added in the LCA Handbook (Guinée et al. 2002) to determine the appropriate level of sophistication (simplified, detailed, …) of the LCA study in relation to its goal and application.
* Temporal coverage:
  - The desired age of data (e.g. within the last five years) and the minimum length of time over which data should be collected (e.g. one year).
* Geographical coverage
  - Geographical area from which data for unit processes should be collected to satisfy the goal of the study (e.g. local, regional, national, continental, global).
* Technology coverage
  - Technology mix (e.g. weighted average of the actual process mix, best available technology or worst-operating unit).
* Coverage of economic processes (initial system boundaries):
  - “Ideally, the product system should be modeled in such a manner that all the inputs and outputs at its boundary are environmental interventions. It is an iterative process to identify the inputs and outputs that should be traced to the environment, i.e. to identify which unit processes producing the inputs (or which unit processes receiving the outputs) should be included in the product system under study. The initial identification is made using available data. Inputs and outputs should be more fully identified after additional data are collected during the course of the study, and then subjected to a sensitivity analysis.”
* Coverage of elementary flows (environmental interventions) and impact categories:
  - “It shall be determined which impact categories, category indicators and characterization models are included within the LCA study. The selection of impact categories, category indicators and characterization models used in the LCIA methodology shall be consistent with the goal of the study”.
* Special case of “coverage of processes”:
  - Exclude life cycle stages or subsystems that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar for each of the (product) systems analysed.
  - Only if focus is on assessing differences between alternative (product) systems.
  - Example: if filling and distribution processes for, e.g., two types of beverage bottles are exactly same.

**Scope definition: example**

“The LCA is carried out to identify hot spots for improvement of processes in the Netherlands, therefore data should be representative of the present state of technology in that country. In this study, we used the most recent data that were available, mainly from 1999.
We have adopted an attributional approach, which may later be extended to a consequential
approach. For the goal of the study simplified guidelines will suffice for most steps.
Total size of the study is 8 man-months. A large amount of this time will be devoted to the collection of representative data of the most important production, recycling and upgrading processes.”

## 4.4 Function, functional unit, and reference flow
### 4.4.1 Function
* A service provided by a product system or unit process, e.g. lighting, transport, enjoying a film, nourishment, etc.
- Or better and more specific: lighting a room of X m2 with light of 1250 lumen
- Etc.
### 4.4.2 Functional unit
* The quantified function provided by the product system(s) under study for use as a reference basis in an LCA, e.g. 1000 hours of light (of 1250 lumen)
- Adapted from ISO
- Original ISO 14040 definition: “{{< hl-text blue>}}quantified performance of a product system for use as a reference unit{{< /hl-text >}}”

### 4.4.3 Generic or strict FU
* The more strictly the functional unit is described, the fewer alternatives will be left to compare ...
- The functional unit ‘watching TV for 1 hour’ may be specified to include more and more functions, as in ‘watching colour TV for 1 hour’, ‘watching 55 inch screen
colour TV for 1 hour’, ‘watching 55 inch screen colour TV with remote control for 1
hour’, etc.,
* … until there are no product alternatives left to compare.

### 4.4.4 Reference flows
* Definition:
  - “quantified flow generally connected to the use phase of a product system and representing one way of obtaining the functional unit”
  - Ref. flow = FU + specific product alternative supplying FU
* Examples (FU “1000 hours light of 1250 lumen” can be supplied by several different reference flows):
  - 1000 hours tube light of 1250 lumen
  - 1000 hours fluorescent light of 1250 lumen
  - 1000 hours incandescent light of 1250 lumen
  - 1000 hours LED light of 1250 lumen

**Schematically**
focusing on fluorescent and incandescent lamp for reasons of space …
* function: lighting a (specific) room
* functional unit: 1000 hours of light
* alternatives: incandescent lamp and fluorescent lamp
* reference flow for system 1: 1000 hours of light with an incandescent lamp
* reference flow for system 2: 1000 hours of light with a fluorescent lamp

**More examples**
* Functional unit:
  - 1 l of orange juice at the point of sale
* Reference flows:
  - 1 l of orange juice at the point of sale adopting PEF technology;
  - 1 l of orange juice at the point of sale adopting NFC technology;
  - 1 l of orange juice at the point of sale adopting FS technology.

* Functional unit:
  - Colouring 20 m2 of wall type X with opacity 98% and durability of 5 years

* Reference flows:
  - Colouring 20 m2 of wall type X with
  opacity 98% and durability of 5
  years using paint A;
  - Colouring 20 m2 of wall type X with
  opacity 98% and durability of 5
  years using paint B;
  - Colouring 20 m2 of wall type X with
  opacity 98% and durability of 5
  years using paint C.

**CMLCA®**
* Just for tomorrow afternoon and for your case study:
In CMLCA software the reference flow is the "Alternative".

**Lessons learned**
* Provide a ‘function’
* {{< hl-text blue>}}FU = ‘function’ + quantification: don’t forget either one{{< /hl-text >}}
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Reference flow = FU + alternative{{< /hl-text >}}
* Define as many separate reference flows as you have alternatives.
* Formulate consistently throughout ‘function’, ‘functional unit’, and ‘reference flows’

The above poses a nice metaphor to some of the existing LCA so far : very exact answers are given to imprecise or vague questions.

# 6. Inventory analysis
“Phase of life cycle assessment involving the compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs, for a given product system throughout its life cycle” [ISO 14040]
Steps involved:
- Refining of system boundaries / determination of cut offs
- Drawing a flow chart / product system
- Collecting unit process data
- Dealing with multi functional processes
- Calculating the life cycle inventory analysis result

Goal: to determine the environmental flows related to a
product system (Life Cycle Inventory)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162694280-3b11619b-de64-49c8-9b71-c853920a8893.png)
## 6.1 Economic and environmental flows and the economy environment system boundary

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Economic vs. environmental flows{{< /hl-text >}}**
{{< hl-text orange>}}Economic flows:{{< /hl-text >}} Products, services, and wastes produced and managed by humans. For example: steel, electricity, and wastewater
{{< hl-text orange>}}Environmental flows:{{< /hl-text >}} 1) Flows entering the product system without prior human transformation , e. land use, freshwater use, metal extraction all resource extraction. 2) Flows leaving the product system without subsequent human transformation , e.g.: emissions (air, soil, water)

## 6.2 Unit processes
> "smallest element considered in the life cycle inventory analysis for which input and output data are quantified"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162695944-80e990f1-2996-4715-9955-6a32bb9e1d19.png)

## 6.3 Cut-offs
{{< hl-text orange>}}Cut offs and system boundaries{{< /hl-text >}}
Rule: {{< hl-text blue>}}Each economic input or output of a unit process should be followed until it has been translated into environmental flows ( e.g. resource extractions and emissions){{< /hl-text >}}
{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples:{{< /hl-text >}}
TV -> transformer -> ~~copper wire~~ -> ~~copper~~ -> ~~copper ore~~
TV -> electricity -> ~~coal, gas, etc~~.
TV -> electronic equipment waste -> removal of precious and recyclable materials -> dump site -> ~~toxins~~

The System Boundary is the demarcation between what is included in the product system and what is excluded (cut off).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162698165-5b157f88-a08e-4615-bdc8-edd9fa5a0199.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Reasons for cut offs{{< /hl-text >}}
* Practical constraints: Lack of data, time/funds
* Ignorance: We may not be aware of certain process inputs/outputs
* Predefined criteria
  - Purpose/motivation of study or leverage of commissioner: e.g. water flows not included
  - Difference analysis: we may leave out certain parts of a system as it is the same for all compared alternatives.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Common system boundaries / cut offs {{< /hl-text >}}
{{< hl-text orange>}}Example: T shirt{{< /hl-text >}}

> “The principles of system boundary definition are decided during the GSD. However , one may have to wait to decide the exact details until enough information has been collected during inventory analysis”[Hitchhikers guide, page 79]

## 6.4 Flow diagrams

**What is it?**
- Simplified graphical representation of a product system
- Showing interdependence of economic processes

**Why do we need it?**
- Useful for modeling a product system
- Great communication tool showing others what your LCA is about

> Constructing a flow diagram is a “cumulative and iterative process with revisions and elaboration as more is learned about the modelled system [...]”
[Hitchhikers guide to LCA: p98]

{{< hl-text orange>}}In reality, supply chains are complex ….{{< /hl-text >}}

## 6.5 Data collection and reporting
{{< hl-text orange>}}Data Collection{{< /hl-text >}}
Incremental steps.
Start with main components, **THEN** add detail.
LCAs require attention to detail **AND** the bigger picture.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Format and data categories (1){{< /hl-text >}}
**Central entity in LCA: “Unit process”**
**General considerations:**
- processes have inputs and outputs
- processes have economic flows and environmental/elementary flows
- several types of each (e.g., materials, energy, atmospheric emissions)
- symmetry in economic flows (output of one process is input of another process)

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Unit process{{< /hl-text >}}**
> "smallest element considered in the life cycle inventory analysis for which input and output data are quantified"

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Data sources{{< /hl-text >}}**
**Primary data:**
- measurements
- stoichiometric calculation /ˌstɔikiə'metrik/化学当量的;化学计算的
- expert interviews
**Secondary data:**
* (scientific) literature
* reports
* **LCI databases** for basic processes and materials (e.g. ecoinvent)

{{< hl-text orange>}}What if we don’t have primary /
secondary data?{{< /hl-text >}}
**Possible solutions:**
- Background (database)
- Provide estimations Proxies
- Omitting mass flows < 1 or 5%, (but check if they could be environmentally relevant, e.g. rare earths)
i.e. Cut off certain flows (Last resource OK as starting point). Report the influence/existence/justification of cut offs.

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Data quality{{< /hl-text >}}**
Crucial to address data quality
- precision
- completeness
- representativeness (temporal, geographical, technology)
- consistency
- reproducibility
No standardised method for overall assessment of data
quality available (Pedigree matrix used in ecoinvent to quantify uncertainty /'pedɪgriː/).

{{< hl-text orange>}}Data Reporting{{< /hl-text >}}
- Report: Assumptions, Calculations (equations, units), and Modifications to database.
- Keep a logbook/ Excel (reproducible results).

{{< hl-text orange>}}Calculation of LCI analysis results{{< /hl-text >}}
**Relating unit processes to reference flow(s)**
- Based on linear scaling of processes
{{< alert info >}} You never need to scale your product system manually! The computer does this for you…{{< /alert >}}
- Matrix algebra solution available
- Take account for (feedback) loops

**Calculation only works, if:**
- One unique supplier for every product
- Multi functionality is resolved

{{< hl-text orange>}}Pitfalls{{< /hl-text >}}
## 6.6 Data pitfalls

  * errors in measurements
  - errors in data entry
  - errors with units (litre versus gallon)
  - errors with prefixes (mg versus mcg)
  - errors with nomenclature (N2O versus NO2)
- … and can sometimes easily be detected
  - comparative analysis of different data sources
  - {{< hl-text blue>}}mass and energy balances{{< /hl-text >}}

## 6.7 Exercise
Function: providing electricity
Functional unit: producing 1kWh of electricity
Alternatives: coal, oil and wind
Resource flows: 	producing 1kWh of electricity from oil
			producing 1kWh of electricity from coal
			producing 1kWh of electricity from wind
could include proper specification low Vol etc, location, (temporal scope), seasonal specification

Function: packaging beverage => contain and maintain beverage
Functional unit: packaging 1 litre of X
Alternatives: reusable beverage container, one-way beverage containers
Resource flows: 	packaging 1 litre of X in a reusable container
			Packaging 1 litre of X in a one-way container
Packaging here is very specific -> what is the function? Containing instead!

Function: consumption of potatoes grown in the NL
Functional unit: consumption of 1kg of potatoes grown in the NL
Alternatives: organic, traditional
Resource flows: 	

Function: exchanging information
Functional unit: 500 words of information to 1000 people for a specific distance? Instant paper? Then what about paper?
Alternatives: email, telephone, paper, sms
Resource flows: transmitting info in 500 words to 1000 people by email/...

{{< hl-text orange>}}My first/second (hypothetical) LCA{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}A. What would be an appropriate function and functional unit for a comparison involving more types of lighting options?{{< /hl-text >}}
Function: lighting
Functional unit: 1000 hours of lighting

{{< hl-text orange>}}B. Define the appropriate (more appropriate than the working-definition provided below) reference flow based on your functional unit for the system depicted above.{{< /hl-text >}}
Resource flow: 1000 hours of lighting with light of 450 lumen LED light bulb in NL.

{{< hl-text orange>}}C.	Redraw the process flow diagram, while omitting the ‘Glass manufacturing’ and ‘Waste disposal’ processes and without connecting to other processes (!!). Do this by drawing the remaining 3 processes as rectangles, then draw the arrows for inflows and outflow for each of the 3 processes (economic flows in vertical direction; environmental flows in horizontal direction) according to the specifications in the above table (but, as said, without connecting to other processes!!). Then insert the quantitative data from the table above next to each of the flows.{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164430880-ff210796-d1e7-4252-9afc-d7bae875be03.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}D.	Calculate the ‘allocation factors’ (which in this case means the share of each of the products in the total energy content), by filling in the table below.{{< /hl-text >}}
|  Product  |  Outflow |  Energy content (GJ) | Allocation factor F1  |
|---|---|---|---|
|Electric power|  500 kWh   |    2   |    0.4   |  
|    Steam     |  1000 kg   |    3   |     0.6  |  
|     Total    |            |        |     1    |  

Electric power 4MJ/kWh electric power
Steam 3 MJ/kg steam

{{< hl-text orange>}}E. Calculate the environmental outflows for the (mono-functional) processes of electric power generation (per 500 kWh electric power) and steam production (per 1000 kg steam):{{< /hl-text >}}
|Environmental outflow|	unit|	Quantity allocated to 500 kWh| electric power	Quantity allocated to 1000 kg steam|
|---|---|---|---|
|CO2|	Kg|	400*0.4 = 160	|240|
|CH4|	Kg|	6*0.4 = 2.4	|3.6|
|N2O| Kg|0.005*0.4 = 0.002 	|0.003|

{{< hl-text orange>}}F. Now redraw the process flow diagram from assignment C, replacing the quantitative process data for ‘Power generation (using Cogeneration)’ by the quantities you have allocated to 500 kWh electric power in assignment E. {{< /hl-text >}}

# 7. CMLCA introduction
## 7.1 Introduction to CMLCA software
CMLCA and corresponding documentation is available at our separate www.cmlca.eu website. For the LCA-PR course we use the CMLCA version that is available through the Blackboard page of the course.

On the other hand, it is developed with the principles of LCA, IOA, etc. in mind, so that it is quite accurate and up-to-date as to methodological details. It is, for example, fully based on {{< hl-text blue>}}matrix algebra{{< /hl-text >}}, although the user may be unaware of that whilst using the program. This implies that process trees with {{< hl-text blue>}}a recursive flow structures{{< /hl-text >}} (steel production needing coal and coal production needing steel), provide no computational problems and are exactly solved. Moreover, the program is very flexible in dealing with {{< hl-text blue>}}allocation of multiple processes{{< /hl-text >}}. In contrast with some other programs, such processes need not be allocated prior to their entry in the database, and the allocation method (substitution, partitioning, or no allocation at all) may be defined for each individual unit process. The program also supports fully hybrid inventories, consisting of process-based and IO-based data. It is rich in its analytical possibilities.

## 7.2 Exercises using CMLCA and ecoinvent
**{{< hl-text orange>}}CMLCA: Scientific software for LCA, IOA, EIOA and more{{< /hl-text >}}**
* Intended to support the technical steps of LCA
* Doesn’t support procedural aspects, like peer review, etc.
* Assumption: user is aware of basic LCA principles
* Just one of many software tools that are available
* Its philosophy is probably somewhat different
* The program develops continuously
* Available through the MST “CMLCA download” channel
and http://cmlca.eu/cmlca61.zip
  - Also see the CMLCA pdf file in the same channel for more info

## 7.3 7 reasons for using CMLCA
- free
- flexible
- perfect for use in class room
- perfect for use by scientists
- compatible with ISO framework and terminology
- does not require an administrator for installation & can be transferred online
- Advanced settings

## 7.4 7 reasons for not using CMLCA
- has no helpdesk
- contains no process data (but we will import ecoinvent)
- contains no impact assessment data (“but we will import these with you”)
- not so good for consultants
- no graphical interface for constructing flow diagrams
- only available in English
- only available for Windows (!!) (but there is a CMLCA-FAQ including “Mac-problems” in the MST “CMLCA download” channel; see “CMLCA Troubleshooting and FAQs.pdf” )

# 8. Case study brainstorm session and topics database
## 8.1 Reflect on a possible topic
* Given the case study requirements, think of a topic (either your own or from the list of previous topics) and elaborate, briefly:
  1. Establish relevance. Why should we care about the topic?
  2. Justify the use of LCA for the case study. Why is it necessary to evaluate life cycles?
    1. What's the comparison

* Helpful to think about the following when selecting a topic
  - WHY: Relevance and LCA justification
  - HOW: How you may approach this (scope)
  - WHAT: what may you obtain from results

{{< hl-text orange>}}Common environmental dilemmas{{< /hl-text >}}
1. Single use vs reusable
2. Bio vs fossil
3. Local vs foreign
4. … others?

{{< hl-text orange>}}Selecting a case study:{{< /hl-text >}}
1. Make sure to involve a comparison
2. Keep it simple; learning LCA is already challenging enough!
For example: cloud vs HD storage, Spotify vs CDs, is too abstract and lacks clear boundaries (e.g., what is the Spotify system and where does it stop? Before you know you need to model all servers behind this system which is practically not feasible)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Do’s and don’ts{{< /hl-text >}}
* Do select an ‘easy topic’!
* Don’t do an LCA on a waste management system: too
complex!!
* Don’t do a case for a commissioner:
  - you won’t often get the data needed, even when ‘promised’ …..
  - LCA-PR case study results are too uncertain
  - the course is about learning LCA, and that’s already challenging enough.

# 9. LCI databases and ecoinvent
## 9.1 LCI database
{{< hl-text orange>}}What is an LCI database{{< /hl-text >}}
- A collection of datasets describing the inputs and outputs of economic activities
  - E.g. material and energy flows , emissions , wastes
  - And meta data process descriptions , modeling and
assumptions , data sources and quality , uncertainties , etc

### 9.2.3 Licence
You may ONLY use the ecoinvent database provided to you in this course within the context of this course and as long as you are a student at Leiden University or Leiden University College.
(LUCML, ecoV3JG62,0)

### 9.2.4 Geographies
For example, Switzerland has the abbreviation CH, Czechia is CZ and China is CN.
Almost every activity in the database is also represented at the global level, using geographical location global (GLO) or Rest-of-the-World (RoW), representing the average global production.

Geographies for the same activity cannot overlap. For example, an activity from Switzerland cannot coexist with the same activity at the European (RER) level since Switzerland is contained within RER. Therefore, geographies such as “Europe without Switzerland” are created. Full and partial overlaps are reported in the geography file.

**Example calculation of the Rest of the World**
Let us assume an activity is available for four different regions: the United States (US), India (IN), China (CN), and Global (GLO).

During the linking, the RoW production is generated as a copy of the global dataset. The production volume (PV) of the RoW activity is calculated by subtracting the production volume of the regional activities from the global volume:

PV RoW = PV GLO – PV US – PV IN – PV CN

In supply chains, the newly generated RoW process connects to other processes with overlapping geographical boundaries.

## 9.3 Activities (Ecoinvent)
{{< hl-text orange>}}Definition of Activity{{< /hl-text >}}
- An Activity is a unit process that represents a human activity and its exchanges with the environment and with the products of other human activities (Technosphere).
- We’ll focus on technosphere exchanges from now on.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164659013-19316278-9c8e-4ae4-947e-9f787dfd27ee.png)

* Activities when unallocated may produce two types of products:
  - Reference product : the reason for carrying out this activity
 - By product / waste : any other output of the activity (These definitions differ from those used in this course (good and waste) although this should not be of consequence for you
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164662667-3c4c4b27-324f-47aa-bfdd-8286f88f617e.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Types of activities: overview{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164663913-7e9641ac-dc40-4a10-b8e8-a784f1d7713b.png)

### 9.3.1 Transforming activities
- Transforming activities are human activities that transform inputs, so that the output of the activity is different from the inputs
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164666070-e3e238e4-5fc2-4c95-94ae-8b54d2e270f1.png)

- The same activity name, different geography
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164666835-2c245ed9-3f21-4a79-a4fe-6b473f676c76.png)

- The same reference product, but different technology
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164667696-e53f2a54-02b9-41e2-ba3d-b6c400896495.png)

- The same reference product, but different technology (and thus potentially also different by products)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164669144-d70c2bc4-128d-478b-8c5d-9389715b1528.png)

### 9.3.2 Transfering activities (markets)
- Market activities are {{< hl-text blue>}}consumption mixes{{< /hl-text >}}.
- They provide products from producing activities to the consuming activities that use them an inputs.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164671717-cc2932f6-ac75-4ef9-bee8-539ea1b90cac.png)

- They add information to the consumption mix:
  - Default information relative to the {{< hl-text blue>}}transport of the product{{< /hl-text >}}
  - {{< hl-text blue>}}Information about losses{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164673969-92ee7c9f-790b-4c3f-8d85-068a75fee707.png)

* Markets for same product can have different geographical locations
- If the location is not GLO (global), we call them {{< hl-text blue>}}regional markets{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164674859-2ff9accc-b1c7-4357-ae0e-5a1e03c4e4e1.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}To retain Activities and markets{{< /hl-text >}}
- There are two basic types of activities in the database: transforming and transferring activities
  - Transforming activities are production or treatment processes
  - Transferring activities are markets
- Market activities are consumption mixes and account
also for transport and losses

### 9.3.3 Treatment activities and markets
{{< hl-text orange>}}Treatment activities{{< /hl-text >}}
- A transforming activity with a reference product with a negative sign
- A treatment activity “treats” (e.g. disposes) a given product
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164676527-a86e796b-2bff-479b-8aee-b60cfe063a2b.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Treatment markets{{< /hl-text >}}
- They also exist for wastes:
- Representing the consumption mix of the waste treatment
- Bearing as well default {{< hl-text blue>}}transport information{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164676739-509d8bcf-d942-4dbe-b3c7-4cefd90253a4.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Another type of transforming
activity: treatment activities{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164677500-71659e40-9a67-4e59-8274-16d0cf11e45e.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Waste from a waste producer to a
treatment activity{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164677642-e5d262cc-65db-4171-ae62-37e565cae716.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Generation of consumption mixes of wastes{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164677942-309c1510-75a6-462e-a1fe-8a196e4d50ac.png)
- Consumption mix market generation and use follow same rules as described
  - based on geography
  - based on product name (different technologies, same market)
  - using production volumes to define market shares
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164678090-76b3e373-50d8-4e92-9d98-dc19cd6df67b.png)

- Note that the same system looks like this if the arrows are flipped
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164678250-ffd56e7c-46f5-4668-b46f-bf852e002c5b.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}To retain{{< /hl-text >}}
* The negative signs allow to maintain the mass balance in the activities
* As with regular products, markets are used to model geographically constrained consumption mixes
* For example: MSW from different producers goes to the market for MSW and from there to different treatment processes (representing the share of treatment processes in a given region)

{{< hl-text orange>}}How does this differ from the CMLCA approach{{< /hl-text >}}

**{{< hl-text orange>}}Negative inputs are the same as positive outputs{{< /hl-text >}}**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164885268-60948c9c-6e58-4789-988a-32ee1109c45c.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Ecoinvent way{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164885614-988e663d-6bb0-4b97-94fc-6cbf023b0355.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}CML way{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164885643-205e7d91-957f-4f77-a83b-3b1316f58426.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Differences CMLCA -ecoinvent{{< /hl-text >}}
* Ecoinvent models wastes like CMLCA as outputs of processes (in LCA software this can be displayed as negative inputs or positive outputs)
* Waste treatment activities in ecoinvent usually have a negative reference product (i.e. they model the service of treating a waste)
* Ecoinvent has a different product classification than CMLCA, e.g. (in the cut-off system model)
  – **Allocatable by-products (BP)**: like goods in CMLCA
  – **Wastes (W): cut-off approach** (waste treatment fully allocated to producing activity; co-products come FREE of burdens)
  – **Recyclable materials (RM)**: RM come FREE of burdens, but environmental impacts from recycling accounted for

{{< hl-text blue>}}In practice you don’t need to worry about this much, but just use the cut-off model like it is…{{< /hl-text >}}

### 9.3.4 Consumption mixes (markets) Global geographical coverage
{{< hl-text orange>}}Consistent generation and use
of consumption mixes{{< /hl-text >}}
- The transforming activities produce products that supply the markets, depending on their geographical localisation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164883657-782af226-a025-4a6e-b46d-e5d7920062db.png)

* There exists always at least one GLO market per product, but regional markets do also exist when it is necessary
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164883671-1209ffe0-0bf6-4e16-8464-8990a414429b.png)

* Consuming activities of those products will get their inputs automatically from the markets that
better cover their geography
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164883700-304881ee-b691-440c-b2b9-4521a5728003.png)

* Direct links to producers can also be used instead of consumption mixes
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164883789-7c382d6a-07e3-4de9-8ced-f464ba59235b.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}To retain : markets consumption mixes{{< /hl-text >}}
- Markets link producing and consuming activities in the geographical boundaries of the markets
- As user, you can always choose to use the producing activities or the consumption mix (market)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Global geographical coverage{{< /hl-text >}}
- All products in the ecoinvent database are covered globally
  - either by 1 GLO activity
  - or by at least 1 regional + 1 RoW activities

- The same logic applies for markets
- If available, regional activities use the inputs from regional markets (e.g. the input of tap water from NL, for a NL activity)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Illustration for Global geographical activity coverage{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164883988-c626916a-8be1-4c9b-9efd-1f9677c0423b.png)

### 9.3.5 Other activities
**Types of activities**
Several types of activities can be distinguished and will be described in more detail below. All activities have exchanges on the input side and on the output side.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/166642567-6d9f03d5-56f8-498a-aa20-efefefb5ed80.png)

Exchanges from and to the environment, also called elementary exchanges, are placed on the input side when a process consumes natural resources, such as iron ore from the ground, water from a river or CO2 taken up from the air into a tree. Elementary exchanges are placed on the output side when a process releases emissions into soil, water or air.

All other exchanges are intermediate exchanges, i.e., the products consumed or produced by a process and exchanged with other processes. On the output side, we distinguish between types of products: reference products and by-products or waste.

**Construction activities**
Infrastructure (i.e., capital goods) in the ecoinvent database is defined as products that have a lifetime that exceeds one year and that are not meant for consumption. This definition includes both stationary infrastructure, such as buildings, electricity or gas grids, roads, rails, mines and production facilities, and mobile infrastructure, such as machinery, tools and vehicles.

An activity producing an immobile infrastructure product often carries the term “construction” in its name. Therefore, these activities are also referred to as construction activities. The reference unit of infrastructure products in the database is most commonly “unit”, e.g., 1 unit of power plant. A construction activity usually covers the initial construction, the maintenance of the infrastructure during its lifetime, the land occupation and land transformation (if applicable) and the decommissioning for waste treatment at the end of the lifetime. The waste streams from decommissioned infrastructure leave the activity as by-product/waste outputs. The mass of the infrastructure thus leaves the construction activity with the waste streams; therefore, infrastructure products are an exception in that they do not come with properties of mass and carbon content.

Instead of mass properties, infrastructure products have properties of “lifetime” and “lifetime capacity”.

**Service activities**
Service activities have inputs and outputs required to perform a service on another product, without the actual input and output of the product receiving the service. Services are therefore defined as immaterial exchanges, i.e., without a physical good changing ownership.
For example, the service of sawing with a power saw does not have an input of the tree standing in the forest. Instead, the forestry process has an input of the tree standing in the forest, an input of power sawing (in hours) and an output of the felled tree. The amount of the saw, the fuel to operate it, the lubricating oil to maintain it and the emissions released during operation enter the forestry process indirectly through the service activity.

**Operation activities**
Processes with the term “operation” as part of their name represent the use of a specific infrastructure product, e.g., “mine operation” as opposed to “mine construction”. Operation datasets thus always have inputs of infrastructure. The term “operation” is used as a synonym for “use”. The term is applied to both industrial activities, e.g., “gold refinery operation”, and household activities, e.g., “operation, computer, desktop”. Operation activities may also fulfil the criteria to be a service activity.

The reference products of operation activities are not of any special type; they are normal products, such as refined gold resulting from gold refinery operation.

## 9.4 Products
## 9.4.1 Reference products
The reference product is the driver of a process. It is the product for which a change in demand will affect the production volume of the process (also known as the determining product). The reference product can be a good or a service.

## 9.4.2 By-products/waste
By-products and waste are co-produced together with the reference product but would not justify performing a process for their own sake. For example, straw is produced together with wheat grain, which is the reference product.

In most situations, by-products can easily be distinguished from reference products. Often, by-products are similar to waste and are therefore not even fully utilised, such as straw.

Within the category of by-products/waste, waste does not have an economic value, whereas by-products do have a value on the market.

The distinction between reference products and by-products/waste is process-specific, i.e., the same product can appear as a reference product in one process and as a by-product/waste of another process.

Every intermediate exchange also carries two by-product classifications that are consistent across all the processes in which the exchange appears. These classifications determine the fate of a by-product within the rules of different system models. Every intermediate exchange is classified as either waste, recyclable or allocatable product, and every intermediate exchange is classified either as a material for treatment (mft) or not a material for treatment (non-mft).

## 9.5 System Models

System models set the methodological rules to calculate the database. All system models start from the same pool of individual processes of human activities (Undefined Unit Processes (UPR)) and apply different assumptions to determine the supply (linking) and the distribution of impacts between producers and consumers of products and services (allocation and substitution).

## 9.6 Unit Process (UPR)
The basic building blocks of the database are individual processes of human activities and their exchanges with the environment (elementary exchanges) and with the technosphere (intermediate exchanges).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/166637440-2842315e-5e58-40dd-bb05-bd3f9cb8109f.png)

The processes in the ecoinvent database represent the average production conditions within a geographical location, rather than company-specific or site-specific conditions. For example, the ecoinvent database would contain a process for the average banana production in Ecuador, rather than for banana production at the farm of a specific fruit company. Furthermore, the contained products are primarily intermediate products rather than final consumer products. For example, the database would contain wheat flour but not pasta made from that flour.

## 9.7 Transport in ecoinvent
{{< hl-text orange>}}Transport is modelled in market activities{{< /hl-text >}}
- The transport of goods in ecoinvent version 3 is mainly included in market activities
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164884267-70797953-71b3-419e-8bd9-6aeafe7d0a0b.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Modes of transport in ecoinvent{{< /hl-text >}}
* Freight
  * Trucks (3.5 -> 32t)
  * Airplanes , helicopter
  * Trains
  * Ship
* Passenger transport (ICVs, EVs)
  - Personal: passenger car, scooter, bicycle
  - Public transport : tram , train, airplane, bus, trolleybus

{{< hl-text orange>}}Transport model simplified{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164884449-44b52db4-6d70-4aa0-a814-210f3955aeef.png)
* Return trip usually empty one way

{{< hl-text orange>}}Global transport model ecoinvent v3{{< /hl-text >}}

- Transport distances are based on a global model for transport distances based on EU,
US, and other statistics, which provides:
  - Product or product group specific transport distances
  - Modes of transport

**This may not always be accurate, especially for locally (not globally) traded products, e.g.:**
  - Construction materials (gravel, concrete, stone)
  - Products with low price and high volumes (tap water)
  - Products which technically cannot be transported (electricity, steam)
  - Waste products
  - Infrastructure (buildings, landfills)

{{< hl-text orange>}}How to model transport in your foreground system?{{< /hl-text >}}
1. Define transport mode (truck, ship, etc)
2. Calculate the transport distance
  - no need to include return trip as this is already included in the ecoinvent datasets
  - If the return trip is full as well, simply divide the one way distance by 2
3. Calculate “load”: transport distance * weight
4. {{< hl-text blue>}}Include the transport as a service (input){{< /hl-text >}} into your foreground system production activities (see example below)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/164884968-c862ea75-4051-47d9-b7d1-9c9205896bd3.png)

Background system (ecoinvent): You do not need to model transport for products you take from existing ecoinvent market activities (it is already modelled for you; if you still want to include your own transport distance, take the product from the producing activity and not the market and add the transport as described above)

## 9.8 System models in ecoinvent
https://ecoinvent.org/the-ecoinvent-database/system-models/
### Allocation, cut-off by classification
{{< hl-text orange>}}Introduction{{< /hl-text >}}
In this system model, {{< hl-text blue>}}wastes are the producer’s responsibility (“polluter pays”){{< /hl-text >}}, and there is an incentive to use recyclable products, that are available burden free (cut-off).

* If a material is recycled, the primary producer does not receive any credit for the provision of any recyclable materials.
* Recyclable materials are available burden-free to recycling processes, and secondary (recycled) materials bear only the impacts of the recycling processes (i.e. collecting, sorting, transporting).
* Producers of wastes do not receive any credit for recycling or reuse of products resulting from any waste treatment.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Handling of by-products by classification{{< /hl-text >}}


{{< hl-text orange>}}1. Handling of waste products{{< /hl-text >}}
**Waste by-products have to be treated, and the treatment burden is allocated completely to the waste-producing activity.**
![image](https://ecoinvent.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cut-off-1-1024x270.png)

Any {{< hl-text blue>}}non-waste by-products{{< /hl-text >}} of a waste treatment process (i.e., not other waste products) are cut off and do not provide credit to the production activity. The cut-off point is therefore the end of the waste treatment, which means that the resulting products are available in the database and can be used as burden-free inputs in other activities.

{{< hl-text orange>}}2. Handling of recyclable materials{{< /hl-text >}}
Recyclable materials are cut off from their production activities through the use of special datasets, denoted as {{< hl-text blue>}}“product name, recycled content cut-off”{{< /hl-text >}}. {{< hl-text blue>}}These datasets have no inputs or emissions and are therefore burden-free{{< /hl-text >}}. In a production activity, the material is recorded as a negative input, as in the case of waste; however, the material is not linked to any treatment activity but simply to the empty process.

{{< hl-text orange>}}3. Handling of allocatable products{{< /hl-text >}}
After the handling of waste and recyclable materials, allocation occurs for all remaining allocatable by-products produced within the activity. This process uses the allocation factors defined in the dataset by the dataset author. {{< hl-text blue>}}As waste and most recyclable materials (except those within recycling chains, where they remain as products) are at this point moved to the input side of the activity, they will be considered similar to other inputs and allocated over the different co-products of the activity{{< /hl-text >}}.

# 10. Multi-functionality
## 10.1 The problem; Definitions & typologies
{{< hl-text orange>}}The problem{{< /hl-text >}}
* There are processes which have more than one function
  - “multifunctional processes”

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162906779-ff6230b0-2855-40bf-a552-a2c3262c0ade.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Definitions and typologies{{< /hl-text >}}
* Multi-functionality = the problem
* Four steps to consistently address the MF problem
  1. what are the good and waste flows of every process?
  2. what are the functional flows of every process?
  3. which processes are multi-functional processes?
  4. how to resolve the problems related to that?
* Allocation = one of the solutions
  - partitioning (the inputs and outputs of) unit processes among product systems

**Step 1: G and W flows**
- Good/product (G) is a flow with an economic value ≥ 0
- Waste is a flow with an economic value < 0

**Step 2: Functional flow**
Functional flow: any of the flows of a unit process that constitute its goal
- good(or product) out flows of a production process
- waste inflows of a waste treatment process
- every process needs at least one functional flow

* A flow is not intrinsically a functional flow, but only with respect to a certain unit process
* More specific:
  * an outflow that is a functional flow for one unit process is a non-functional inflow for one or more other unit processes
  - an inflow that is a functional flow for a specific unit process is a non-functional outflow for one or more other unit processes
* Step 3: Multi-functional process
* Multi-functional process: a unit process yielding more than one functional flow
  - co-production: more than one functional outflow and no functional inflow (producing 2 or more goods)
  - combined waste processing: no functional outflow and more than one functional inflow (processing 2 or more wastes)
  - recycling: producing ≥1 good(s) + processing ≥1 waste(s)

## 10.2 System boundary & multi-functionality; The price criterion
{{< hl-text orange>}}In between conclusions{{< /hl-text >}}
* Definition of G and W is important: may determine whether a process is multi-functional or not
  - In case of recycling it matters at which point W flips to G as that determines how much impact is allocated to your product system (see Int J LCA article of allocation exercise later this afternoon)
* Non-functional waste flows (waste outflows) should be traced down to a process that will manage this waste outflow (waste management process), and that non-functional good/product inflows should be traced up to a process that produced them
  - both need to be included within the system boundaries of your ‘reference flow’.

{{< hl-text orange>}}The price criterion{{< /hl-text >}}
How to determine if flow is G or W:
* Price/direction determines:
  - if a process is to be included
  - if a process is multi-functional
  - extent to which a process is included in case of multi-functionality
    - price<0: exclude
    - price>0: include a bit
    - price>>0: include a lot
* Is there any other principle than “price” for determining if a flow is functional or not?

## 10.3 Solutions to the MF problem; Discussion
{{< hl-text orange>}}ISO’s solutions to the multi-functionality problem{{< /hl-text >}}
Possible solutions:
- more refined data collection
- system expansion (accept extra functions as extra reference flow(s))
- Substitution (Not mentioned by ISO)
- partitioning (=allocation, get rid of extra functions by an extra modelling step)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Allocation according to ISO{{< /hl-text >}}
* Solution 1: Wherever possible, allocation should be avoided by:
  - dividing the unit process to be allocated into two or more sub-processes and collecting the input and output data related to these sub-processes (“more refined data collection”)
  - expanding the product system to include the additional functions related to the co-products (“system expansion”)
* Solution 2: Partition inputs and outputs in a way which reflects the underlying physical relationships between them (“physical allocation”)
* Solution 3: Partition inputs and outputs in a way which reflects other relationships between them
  - e.g., in proportion to the economic value of the products (“economic allocation”)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Example applying the ISO solutions{{< /hl-text >}}
**Solution 1a: more refined data collection**
{{< hl-text orange>}}Solving multi-functional “problem” by re-iteration of process specification & data collection{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162926873-5304a0aa-caa4-420b-87b5-466ee4c71e4c.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Solution 1b: system expansion{{< /hl-text >}}
* E.g., comparing 2 ways of disposing 1 kg of plastics
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162927705-7acfb396-56f7-45e4-bbb8-57cebe9ab7e4.png)

but are you still doing a waste management LCA? (‘managing waste’, or ‘managing waste + plastic + heat’)

* Change system boundary
* Include extra function(s) in functional unit
* Must also do this for the other alternatives

{{< hl-text orange>}}Solution 1b: “substitution”{{< /hl-text >}}
* Defining an “avoided” process with subsequent “avoided” interventions/impacts
  - also known as “avoided burden approach”
* But which process is avoided?
  - particularly important for energy substitution (coal, gas, hydro …)

* Change system boundary
* Add extra process
* Subtract “avoided” process
* With consequences upstream and downstream
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162929811-d544d17f-a06b-4053-b33d-dc275ab7c9d4.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Substitution: another example{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162930852-0880f8a3-94b3-4fb4-aec1-66e6cb7c5547.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}System expansion ≠ substitution{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Solution 2: physical allocation/partitioning{{< /hl-text >}}
* Effectively splitting the multi-functional process into several ‘virtual’ mono-functional processes

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162931749-73675123-c0b0-4eff-8565-38010625a331.png)
but what is the basis for splitting? (how to determine x?)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Basic principle of physical allocation{{< /hl-text >}}
The basic principle of allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other (non-functional) flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to some physical allocation principle.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Physical allocation / partitioning{{< /hl-text >}}
* Allocate only a part of the process to the function considered
* With consequences upstream and downstream

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/162933489-17082ead-e51d-4a11-aaed-479ed0d61538.png)
**Energy based** physical allocation but can also be on basis of mass, volume, other…

{{< hl-text orange>}}Solution 3: economic allocation{{< /hl-text >}}
* We already used the price for distinguishing between goods & wastes
  * a good is a flow between two processes with an economic value higher than or equal to zero
  * a waste is a flow between two processes with an economic value smaller than zero
* (Functional flows are either products produced by a process or wastes treated by a process)
* So, why not use it for allocation too ….

{{< hl-text orange>}}Basic principle of economic allocation{{< /hl-text >}}
The basic principle of economic allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other (non-functional) flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Proceeds{{< /hl-text >}}
* Allocation factors based on shares in proceeds (total amount produced (unit) ×
economic value (€/unit))
  - no absolute values needed
  - any monetary unit, if the same
  - any base year, if the same

{{< hl-text orange>}}Problems{{< /hl-text >}}
* Market prices not known
* Fluctuating prices
* Inflation
* Trends in real prices
* Market distortions
* Markets not yet existing
* …

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples: tilapia{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Discussion{{< /hl-text >}}
Is there one correct solution?
* Allocation problem is artefact of wishing to isolate 1 function out of the economic spider web
* Artefacts can only be cured in an artificial way; there is no “correct” way, even not in theory
* So what to do if different solutions result in highly different outcomes?
  - **sensitivity analysis**

{{< hl-text orange>}}Summary: 4 mandatory steps to report on for your LCA case study{{< /hl-text >}}
**Report** for each (foreground) process:
1. Which flows are a good (G) or waste (W)?
  - what criterion is applied for this distinction?
2. What are the functional flow(s) (F)?
3. Which processes are multi-functional?
4. Which solution(s)/method(s) have been selected and applied including sensitivity analyses and why
  - for co-production process: mandatory to apply economic partitioning and another solution as sensitivity analyses.

# 11. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)
## 11.1 Definition of LCIA
* ISO: Phase of life cycle assessment aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts of a product system.
* Often abbreviated to LCIA
for co-production process: mandatory to apply economic partitioning and another solution as sensitivity analyses
## 11.2 The principle of characterization
* ISO definition: factor derived from a characterization model which is applied to convert the assigned LCI results to the common unit of the category indicator.
* Examples: GW{{< hl-text blue>}}P{{< /hl-text >}}, A{{< hl-text blue>}}P{{< /hl-text >}}

* CO2 and CH4 both contribute to {{< hl-text blue>}}climate change (impact category){{< /hl-text >}}.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Global Warming Potential (GWP, characterization factor){{< /hl-text >}}: measure for climate change in terms of {{< hl-text blue>}}radiative forcing (category indicator){{< /hl-text >}} of a mass-unit of greenhouse gas.
* Example calculation:
  - 5 kg CO2, GWP = 1
  - 3 kg CH4, GWP = 28
  - 1 x 5 + 28 x 3 = {{< hl-text blue>}}89 kg CO2-eq (category indicator result){{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Simple conversion & aggregation{{< /hl-text >}}

## 11.3 Selection of impact categories, category indicators and characterization models
{{< hl-text orange>}}Defining impact categories: 2 main approaches{{< /hl-text >}}
* Midpoint-oriented (CML-IA, EDIP, TRACI, …)
* Endpoint-oriented: damage approaches (Eco-indicator 99, Ecoscarcity, EPS, …)
* And hybrid approaches combining/harmonizing
  - midpoint and endpoint (Impact 2002+, ReCiPe, ...)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Impact category{{< /hl-text >}}
* ISO definition: class representing environmental issues of concern to which LCI results may be assigned.
* Examples: climate change, acidification

{{< hl-text orange>}}Category indicator{{< /hl-text >}}
* ISO definition: quantifiable representation of an impact category
* Examples: infrared radiative forcing, proton release

{{< hl-text orange>}}Characterization model{{< /hl-text >}}
* Non-ISO definition: mathematical model of the impact of elementary flows with respect to a particular category indicator
* Examples: IPCC model for climate change, RAINS model for acidifying substances
* Provides the basis for a characterisation factor

{{< hl-text orange>}}More examples of characterization models{{< /hl-text >}}
* Human toxicity, ecotoxicity: USEtox model (Rosenbaum et
al, 2008)
* PM/Respiratory inorganics: RiskPoll model (Rabl & Spadaro, 2004)
* Eutrophication, aquatic: EUTREND model (Struijs et al, 2009b) in ReCiPe
* Photochemical ozone formation: LOTOS-EUROS model (Van Zelm et al, 2008)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Models{{< /hl-text >}}
* We could spend weeks to discuss each of these models, but won’t do that
  - there are (academic) institutes dedicated to developing & improving characterisation models only
* Developing these models is hard work

## 11.4 Classification
* ISO definition: assignment of LCI results to impact categories
* Example: CO2 and CH4 are assigned to climate change
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163559158-02fd8788-7ca0-45ba-b8d6-6f88806d43a5.png)

## 11.5 Characterization
* ISO definition: calculation of category indicator results
* Example: 5 kg CO2 and 3 kg CH4 yield 89 kg CO2-eq

{{< hl-text orange>}}General equation{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163559315-1ffbd785-e185-47ae-8802-b63bfbd09bde.png)
* Unit of (category) indicator result:
  - kg CO2-eq (climate change)
  - kg SO2-eq (acidification)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Example of characterization table{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163559586-3e52886f-26d0-470c-add6-de9c57a73254.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Models & characterization factors{{< /hl-text >}}
* Theory: complicated models, many substances
* Practice: complete sets implemented in software:
  - Characterization and other impact assessment steps = push of a button

  - BUT:
  - incomplete coverage of impact categories
  - always some missing characterization factors

{{< hl-text orange>}}Incomplete coverage of impact categories{{< /hl-text >}}
* LCA has essentially a flow character:
  - inventory table: emissions/ resource extractions in kg per functional unit
  - characterization table: climate change / toxicity / depletion / etc. per functional unit
* Some impacts do not fit well:
  - loss of biodiversity/introduction of GMOs/etc.
* Other impacts simply subject to a lot of debate:
  - toxicity
  - resource depletion

{{< hl-text blue>}}Again …. there is no such thing as the GWP, ADP, ODP, …. of “1 kg of dry edible mussel flesh” !!{{< /hl-text >}}

## 11.6 Normalization
* ISO definition: calculation of the magnitude of category indicator results to reference information
* Reference information (over a given period of time):
  - area (e.g., France, Europe, the world)
  - person (e.g., a Danish citizen)
  - product (e.g., the most frequently used product)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Aim of normalization{{< /hl-text >}}
To better understand the relative magnitude for each indicator results
of the product system under study.
  - checking for inconsistencies
  - providing and communicating information on the relative significance of the
indicator results
  - preparing for additional procedures

{{< hl-text orange>}}Normalized indicator result{{< /hl-text >}}
* Formula:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163766216-135d8982-427e-480e-89ba-efd30a479f00.png)
* Unit of normalization result: year

{{< hl-text orange>}}Equation for calculating the category total{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163766302-7fcc4a92-f820-418a-a81f-52076a71bdcb.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}And …result only valid for one specific “emission – year – region – CF/method” combination: for example, GWGWP100 result ≠ GWGWP500 result{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163767019-eade347a-949c-4c44-874c-41eb7515bc92.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Some categories constitute flawed normalization results{{< /hl-text >}}
* Toxicity related categories:
  - Missing global inventory results (emissions)
  - Missing characterization factors
* PEF category ionising radiation:
  - For the PEF category ionising radiation, normalized indicator results are approximately 1000 times higher compared to results for other categories
  - Again probably due to:
    - Missing global inventory results (emissions)
    - Missing characterization factors

{{< hl-text orange>}}Limitations of normalization{{< /hl-text >}}
* Normalization ≠ weighting !!!
- Don’t aggregate normalization results over different impact categories without
further weighting!
* Category totals may have huge data gaps leading to flawed normalization (and related weighting) results.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Example of a normalization table{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163767669-6c2f0b75-b0a6-460b-bddc-6e3ede61b521.png)

## 11.7 Weighting
* ISO definition: converting and possibly aggregating indicator results
across impact categories using numerical factors, also called ‘weighting factors’
  - based on value-choices
  - ISO: “weighting shall not be used for comparative assertions disclosed to the
public”

{{< hl-text orange>}}Weighting factor{{< /hl-text >}}
* Definition: a factor obtained with a weighting method and used to express a particular (normalised) indicator result in terms of the common unit of the weighting result.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Basis for weighting factors{{< /hl-text >}}
* Monetary values
  - willingness-to-pay
  - damage costs
  - reduction costs
* Distance-to-target methods
* Panel methods
  - expert panels
  - non-expert panels
* ...

{{< hl-text orange>}}Equations{{< /hl-text >}}

* Unit of weighted index:
  - year (when based on normalized results)
  - euro, dollar, etc. (when based on monetary valuation)

## 11.9 Choosing the right climate metric and time horizon
https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/EM/C8EM00414E
* Methane is a second largest contributor to climate change next to carbon dioxide
* methane has a perturbation life of only **12.4** years
* The 100 year time horizon is most common, giving a CO2 equivalent value of **28–36** for methane (depending on whether various indirect climate effects are included (oxidation to CO2 and impact on ozone creation)).
* criticism about the use of GWP:
  - The selected time horizon has a large impact on the value of the metric;
  - Despite its name, it does not compare gases against their effect on global temperature
  - Measures an average climate forcing effect of a single pulse emission over time but gives no indication of the climate impact at an end-point in time, or that of a sustained emission.
* An increase in radiative forcing results in a temperature increase, where the degree of temperature rise is governed by the magnitude of emission (**emission quantity**) and **radiative efficiency**, as well as the existing atmospheric **concentration** of the GHG and the concentrations of **other gases** in the atmosphere (e.g.OH-and O3) .

## 11.10 Energy use as an indicator for environmental performance
* Cumulative Energy Demand (CED): the direct and indirect energy use throughout the life cycle, including the energy consumed during the extraction, manufacturing, and disposal of the raw and auxiliary materials.
* Method: EF v2.0 2018 - energy resources: non-renewable - abiotic depletion potential (ADP): fossil fuels
* Upper Heating Values of Fossil Primary Energy Resources (MJ kg-1):
  - Coal, brown, in ground, 10
  - Coal, hard, unspecified, in ground, 19
  - Gas, natural, in ground, 40
  - Oil, crude, in ground, 46
  - Peat, in ground,	12.5
  - Uranium, in ground, 5.6e+05
* We conclude that **{{< hl-text blue>}}the use of fossil fuels{{< /hl-text >}}** is an important driver of several environmental impacts and thereby indicative for many environmental problems.
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Land use{{< /hl-text >}} should be used as a separate indicator for environmental performance, next to fossil CED.
* A major reason for this high uncertainty is non-fossil energy related emissions and land use, such as landfill leachates, radionuclide emissions, and land use in agriculture and forestry.

# 12. Life Cycle Interpretation
## 12.1 Definition of life cycle interpretation
* ISO: Phase of life cycle assessment in which the findings of either the inventory analysis or the impact assessment, or both, are combined consistent with the defined goal and scope in order to reach conclusions & recommendations
* The fourth and last phase of an LCA
  - no abbreviation like LCI or LCIA
{{< hl-text orange>}}Procedural approaches: interpretation in ISO 14044{{< /hl-text >}}
* Identification of significant issues
* Evaluation
  - completeness check
  - sensitivity check
  - consistency check
* Conclusions, recommendations and reporting
  - critical review

## 12.2 Procedural approaches: interpretation in ISO 14044
* Objective: to structure the results from LCI and/or LCIA in order to determine significant issues (‘hot spots’), e.g. certain:
  - inventory data such as energy, emissions, waste, …
  - impact categories such as resource use, climate change, …
  - significant contributions from life cycle stages to total LCI or LCIA results such as individual unit processes or groups of processes, …

{{< hl-text orange>}}Evaluation (ISO 14044){{< /hl-text >}}
* Objective: to establish and enhance the confidence in and the reliability of the results:
 - completeness check: to ensure that all relevant information and data are available and complete
- sensitivity check: to assess the reliability of the final results and conclusions
- consistency check: to determine whether the assumptions, methods and data are consistent with the goal and scope

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of completeness checks (ISO 14044){{< /hl-text >}}

* ISO: “The objective of the completeness check is to ensure that all relevant information and data needed for the interpretation are available and complete. If any relevant information is missing or incomplete, the necessity of such information for satisfying the goal and scope of the LCA shall be considered. This finding and its justification shall be recorded. If any relevant information, considered
necessary for determining the significant issues, is missing or incomplete, the preceding phases (LCI, LCIA) should be revisited or, alternatively, the goal and scope definition should be adjusted. If the missing information is considered unnecessary, the reason for this should be recorded.”

* Examination of difference in data completeness between alternatives compared, by expert judgment, intuition, reputation of data suppliers, …
* Compare your study with other similar studies
  - Note: no 2 LCAs are really comparable !
* Check differences in completeness between alternatives compared
  - E.g., differences in completeness of flowcharts, cut-offs made, ….
* Identify differences in type and number of substances not captured by characterization between alternatives compared
  - CMLCA: “Flows without characterization factors” in “Classification” menu

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of sensitivity checks (ISO 14044){{< /hl-text >}}
* Determining how final case study results are affected by data uncertainties, allocation methods, characterization methods, etc.
* Sensitivity check shall include the results of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis, if performed in the preceding phases (LCI, LCIA)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of consistency checks{{< /hl-text >}}
* ISO: The objective of the consistency check is to determine whether the assumptions, methods and data are consistent with the goal and scope. If relevant to the LCA or LCI study the following questions shall be addressed.
  - Are differences in data quality along a product system life cycle and between
different product systems consistent with the goal and scope of the study?
  - Have regional and/or temporal differences, if any, been consistently applied?
  - Have allocation rules and the system boundary been consistently applied to all
product systems?
  - Have the elements of impact assessment been consistently applied?”

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of consistency checks{{< /hl-text >}}
* Differences in data sources, e.g.,
  - product A literature; product B primary data
* Differences in data accuracy, e.g.,
- A detailed processes; B cumulated black-box system
* Differences in technology coverage, e.g.,
- A experimental data; B existing large-scale technology
* Differences with time-related coverage, e.g.,
- A brand-new technology; B outdated technology mix
* Differences in data age, e.g.,
- A 5-year old primary data; B recently collected data
* Differences in geographical coverage, e.g.,
- A repr. EU technology mix; B one EU member state

{{< hl-text orange>}}Discussion (for your case study report){{< /hl-text >}}
* discuss consistency, completeness, sensitivity etc. in relation to goal of student's specific case study; not just in general terms repeating the
theory
* With everything you found, uncertainties, gaps you had, can you answer that RQ, what is the validity of that answer, importance of cutoffs, choices you made (e.g. FU), possibly putting your results in a bigger picture, ….

{{< hl-text orange>}}Conclusions and recommendations{{< /hl-text >}}
* Objective: to draw conclusions and make recommendations for the intended audience
* Important topics:
  - transparent reporting
    - all ISO aspects (phases, steps, data, assumption, choices) can be easily found
    - how to report results
  - critical review
    - role and exact form depend on goal of the study

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of conclusions{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163783858-2d168bce-0f69-436f-991d-fc01f859a6f4.png)

* Conclusions should comprise of the main results and a discussion of its validity and reliability
  - summary of significant issues
  - evaluation of methodology and results applying consistency and completeness checks, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
  - main conclusions as relate to goal and scope of study, data quality, assumptions,
etc.

{{< hl-text orange>}}Examples of conclusions: formulate carefully- consistent with goal and scope of study{{< /hl-text >}}
* LCA focusing on climate change impacts only:
  - you can’t formulate a conclusion as: “Product A performs environmentally better
than product B …”.
  - You can only conclude: “On climate change impacts, product A performs better
that product B ….. Trade-offs to other impact categories have not been analysed”
.. or something similar.

* Conclusions are only valid for the systems analysed, and not for other systems!
  - LCA results for 1 litre packaging do not automatically also apply to 1.5 litre
packaging

{{< hl-text orange>}}Formulate carefully – cont’d - include results of earlier steps from your LCA -{{< /hl-text >}}
* Inconsistencies, incompleteness, sensitivities, uncertainties and errors (that cannot be repaired)
  - should either be corrected or incorporated in conclusions & recommendations of the study
* Studies often include sensitivity analyses
  - but don’t mention their results in the conclusions

## 12.3 Numerical approaches
{{< hl-text orange>}}From ISO procedural to numerical approaches for practice{{< /hl-text >}}
* ISO only provides procedural approaches, no guidance on numerical approaches
* Numerical approaches have been added by LCA methodology developers to basically implement the ISO guidelines in practice!!
* From ‘checks’ to ‘analysis’

{{< hl-text orange>}}Numerical approaches{{< /hl-text >}}
* Contribution analysis {{< hl-text blue>}}ISO: "identification of significant issues"{{< /hl-text >}}
* Perturbation analysis {{< hl-text blue>}}ISO: "Sensitivity check"{{< /hl-text >}}
* Comparative analysis
* Other sensitivity (than perturbation) analysis (tomorrow)
* Uncertainty analysis (optional; tomorrow)
* Discernibility analysis (not treated)
* Key issue analysis (not treated)
* …..

{{< hl-text orange>}}Contribution analysis{{< /hl-text >}}
* Also known as dominance or hot-spot analysis: decompose results into contributing items (e.g. % of total)
* Can be performed at several levels:
  - inventory analysis
  - characterization
  - normalization
  - weighting
* Can be performed on different items:
  - processes
  - interventions
  - impact categories

{{< hl-text orange>}}Example 1: Process contribution for fresh mussel processing and consumption{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163791918-ca203362-0ae5-474e-b481-b945f09edbe2.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Example 2: Process contribution to impact categories of biomethane production from offshore-cultivated seaweed{{< /hl-text >}}
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163792324-24dfec89-e418-4f6f-9909-b87bc479229c.png)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Purpose{{< /hl-text >}}
* Application-oriented:
  - results of contribution analysis may provide opportunities for redesign, prevention strategies, etc.
* Analysis-oriented:
  - precise knowledge of data is more important for highest contributors, than for
those that hardly contribute
  - testing results against what one would intuitively expect

{{< hl-text orange>}}Restrictions{{< /hl-text >}}
* {{< hl-text blue>}}‘False negatives’{{< /hl-text >}} due to underestimated or missing flows cannot be identified with contribution analysis
* Problems with “negative contributions” (due to negative emissions, e.g. CO2 uptake, applying ‘avoided burdens' approach, or a negative CF)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/163793965-78bc879d-5a27-422d-8eb8-bdd67143ed4f.png)
* Results only indicate direct contributions of item (e.g., CO2 emission) analyzed
  - use process expected to be dominant in LCA of TV
  - however, TVs don’t emit themselves (‘clean’ process), but may use lot of kWh -> power generation dominant

{{< hl-text orange>}}Only direct contributions: matrices{{< /hl-text >}}
* Consult CMLCA -> Inventory results (-> v More) -> Matrices
  - Technology (A) – Original: shows the economic process data of ecoinvent processes + added processes (and/or ecoinvent changes) by user
  - Satellite (B) – Original: shows the environmental process data of ecoinvent processes + added processes (and/or ecoinvent changes) by user
  - Transformed matrix: square A-matrix based on the results of cut-offs and allocation
  - Scaled transformed technology (A) matrix: A-matrix times the scaling vector; for every row (product) you get exactly the final demand, which for most products is zero except for your FU/reference flow
  - Scaled transformed satellite (B) matrix: B-matrix times the scaling vector; for every row (extension) you get exactly the inventory results for your FU; note that the results are provided per process which constitutes the basis of the CMLCA contribution analysis
  - (Inverted technology matrix is the basis for calculating the scaling vector; see Tuesday’s lecture)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Contribution analysis{{< /hl-text >}}
* The standard contribution analysis calculates the contributions by each process (≥ 14889 columns if ecoinvent is used!) to the total
* Other analyses are possible but basically aggregate processes (columns) in groups:
  - Stages
  - Background/foreground
  - Any label …
  - Region
  - Year
* In scientific publications it’s often not explained how life cycle stage contribution analyses have been performed while these may contain a lot of choices

{{< hl-text orange>}}Perturbation analysis{{< /hl-text >}}
* Also known as marginal analysis or sensitivity analysis: investigate inherently unstable items
  - change data/factor with 1%, and determine how much a result is changed
* Multiplier: extent to which perturbation of certain input parameter
propagates into certain output result
  - if an increase of 1% of an input parameter leads to an increase of 2% of an output result, multiplier 2
  - if output result decreases by 2%, multiplier is -2
  - multipliers restricted to marginally small changes

{{< hl-text orange>}}Levels and items{{< /hl-text >}}
* Can be performed at several (output) levels: inventory analysis; characterization; normalization; weighting
* Can be performed at all (input) process data (technology matrix A)
* No specification of parameter uncertainties needed
* Contrary to contribution analysis, perturbation analysis covers both
  economic and environmental flows

{{< hl-text orange>}}Purposes & restrictions{{< /hl-text >}}
* Purposes:
  - application oriented: results of perturbation analysis may provide opportunities
for redesign, prevention strategies, etc.
  - analysis oriented: precise knowledge of data is most important for highest multipliers
* Restrictions:
  - time-consuming for numerical solutions; analytical solutions very fast

{{< hl-text orange>}}Comparative analysis{{< /hl-text >}}
* Systematic place to list the LCA results for different product alternatives simultaneously
* Can be performed at several levels
  - inventory analysis
  - characterization
  - normalization
  - weighting

{{< hl-text orange>}}Purposes & restrictions{{< /hl-text >}}
* Purposes:
  - to provide presentations of results on the basis of which different product alternatives can easily be compared
* Restrictions:
  - comparative analysis is seductively simple
  - dangerous, because it may easily induce claims without a proper analysis of robustness of these claims with respect to influence of uncertainties

## 12.4 Concluding remarks
{{< hl-text orange>}}Concluding remarks: future of interpretation{{< /hl-text >}}
* Numerical approaches will win ground, particularly uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
* Dilemma:
  - need to improve LCA-software so that uncertainty estimates of input parameters
can be handled
  - need to add uncertainty estimates to LCA-databases (uncertainty data)
  - most current LCA software cannot deal with them, lowering priority for collecting
such data

{{< hl-text orange>}}What should you do now?{{< /hl-text >}}
* Use common sense to identify data quality issues
* Apply contribution analysis to identify hot-spots
* Apply sensitivity analysis
* Identify limitations of:
  - LCA as tool, and
  - study at stake

* Use common sense to formulate conclusions and recommendations properly reflecting potential data issues, hot-spots, and identified limitations.

{{< hl-text orange>}}And … why are my results as they are?{{< /hl-text >}}
* Always critically ask yourself “why are my results as they are?”
  - Do they feel intuitively correct?
  - If not, can you explain why they are counter-intuitive?
  - What are the key processes or variables explaining differences between alternatives?
  - ….

* And thus ….:
  - Can you explain them to third parties involved?
  - Can you base correct and clear conclusions and recommendation on them?

# 13. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
## 13.1 Difference between sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis
What’s the difference?
* Although closely related, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis comprise of
different techniques
  - Local sensitivity analysis (one at a time (OAT)) assesses the changes in results due an arbitrary change in a single input parameter (ignoring its uncertainty)
  - Global sensitivity analysis assesses the contributions of the inputs to the total uncertainty in analysis outcomes taking into account the simultaneous variation of (all) input variables
  - Uncertainty analysis assesses the uncertainty in model outputs as a result of uncertainty in inputs

What do they mean in LCA?
* LCA practice so far has mainly focused on local SA (not needing any uncertainty
data as input), but this is slowly changing to including uncertainty analysis and
occasionally also GSA

{{< hl-text orange>}}“Uncertainty” is the overall term for the topic of
SA and UA; it can be subdivided into:{{< /hl-text >}}
* Uncertainty
due to lack of knowledge about a “true” value
  - can be reduced by more / better knowledge or more accurate precise measurements
  - Data uncertainty, model uncertainty, ….
* Variability
due to variation in data sample
  - Cannot be reduced but better and more sampling can improve knowledge about the variability
  - Spatial variability, Temporal variability, Variability between objects and sources
* Uncertainty in this lecture now refers to both uncertainty and variability, and can either be approached by SA or UA
  * Uncertainty and variability hard to distinguish in practice anyway, and often lumped (al

{{< hl-text orange>}}Uncertainties in LCA - Example of a smartphone LCA {{< /hl-text >}}
* Functional unit (SMS, call, email)
* LCI (knowledge about the supply chain)
  * Material inputs
  * Manufacturing
  * Distribution
  * Use
  * Disposal
* Data Sources
* Allocation Choice
* Characterization (LCIA; e.g., fate & transport modelling)

## 13.2 Local sensitivity analysis
{{< hl-text orange>}}Ad-hoc one-at-a-time (OAT) local sensitivity analysis (common practice in LCA today){{< /hl-text >}}
1. Define the subject of the sensitivity analysis:
  - Ad hoc changing parameters, choices, … (“scenarios”)
  - Systematic change of parameters (perturbation analysis; only parameters, not choices)
2. Evaluate change in results
3. If comparative, how does it affect conclusions & recommendations?

## 13.3 Uncertainty analysis (Optional)
{{< hl-text orange>}}Storyline in a nutshell{{< /hl-text >}}
* Easy to understand that LCA results are uncertain
* But today we can treat uncertainties
* However, we need to understand that LCA is also relative: thus we need to properly combine uncertain and relative
* And we need not only to include uncertainty on data but also for methodological choices
* Let’s briefly discuss some lessons and principles

{{< hl-text orange>}}Most LCA studies today{{< /hl-text >}}
* Don’t consider uncertainty or mention it only a bit in the discussion
* Check yourself: how many articles did you read in the past year in which
  - histograms or standard deviations of LCA results appeared
  - hypothesis test (“product A is better than product B”) appeared
* Most studies
  - mention some uncertain issues (“end-of-life data is quite uncertain”)
  - do one or two scenarios (“we recalculated results with a much shorter life span”)
  - ignore uncertainty whatsoever
  - state results in point values and many digits (e.g. 42.010347)

{{< hl-text orange>}}But we all know LCA is uncertain{{< /hl-text >}}
* LCAs and PCFs of identical products can deviate by an order of magnitude
  - process data (empirical, modelled, from databases)
  - choices on allocation
  - characterization factors
* However, several methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainties ….
* and some data are available
  - pedigree-based uncertainty
  - different data sets for same unit process
  - different LCIA methods

{{< hl-text orange>}}Obtaining uncertainty data is still a huge challenge Pedigree Matrix: Data Quality Indicators{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Treating uncertainty (for data){{< /hl-text >}}
* By way of example

* The value of 𝑥 differs
  - per car type
    - may have to be averaged over different car types depending on G&S
  - but even per car of the same type depending on:
    - driver
    - weather type
    - day and time of the day
    - ...

* Consequently, there is no “true value” of 𝑥
* The value of 𝑥 is a realization of a stochastic variable 𝑋
* We should specify a probability distribution for 𝑋
* (e.g., normal with mean 5 and standard deviation 1)
* So, 𝑥 is a realization of 𝑋~𝑁 (5,1)

* There is also no “true value” of 𝑦
* The value of 𝑦 is a realization of a stochastic variable 𝑌
* We should specify a probability distribution for 𝑌 (e.g., normal with
mean 2 and standard deviation 0.1)
* So, 𝑦 is a realization of 𝑌~𝑁 (2,0.1)

* There is also no “true value” of 𝑧 etc.
* The value of 𝑧 is a realization of a stochastic variable 𝑍; the value of 𝑢 is a realization of a stochastic variable 𝑈; etc.
* We can use the methods of probability theory to calculate the distribution of 𝑍, 𝑈, etc., e.g. Monte Carlo simulation

{{< hl-text orange>}}Monte Carlo (MC) simulation{{< /hl-text >}}
* MC requirements: mean, variance and distribution for each unit process data point
* In MC, values are randomly sampled from the unit process distributions over a
fixed number of iterations and aggregated into LCA results using LCA calculation
software

* The value of 𝑢 differs, just as that of 𝑥
  - per car type, etc.
* But 𝑥 and 𝑢 do not vary independently
  - more gas in, more CO2 out
  - 𝑥 high, 𝑢 high
* So, 𝑋 and 𝑈 are correlated

{{< hl-text orange>}}LCA is relative{{< /hl-text >}}
* OK, there are cases where LCA is absolute
  - one stand-alone analysis, for finding hot-spots
  - LCAbsolute, an initiative to reconcile LCA and planetary boundaries
* but in the vast majority of cases the purpose is (comparative)
  - GWA > GWB
* rather than (absolute)
  - GWA=12.4±2.1 and GWB=11.8±1.9
* Comparative requires MC dependent sampling & A-B comparison per MC run

* So, not 1000 MC runs for A and then 1000 MC runs for B; but 1000 simultaneous MC runs for A and B while calculating A-B for each run (since only for a specific MC run, the data for shared processes is similar for A and B)

# 15. Case study design and reporting
## 15.1 Reporting & writing tips
{{< hl-text orange>}}Course study goals{{< /hl-text >}}
* Write an LCA research proposal;
* Conduct an LCA study;
* Report LCA results in a reproducible manner;
* Understand the possibilities and constraints of their LCA study.
** Convince us that you understand LCA!**
{{< hl-text orange>}}Scientific writing tips{{< /hl-text >}}
* Follow our mandatory reporting guidelines!!
* In addition: use LCA Handbook (structure)
* {{< hl-text blue>}}One topic per paragraph{{< /hl-text >}}
* {{< hl-text blue>}}Avoid long sentences{{< /hl-text >}}
* Use proper and simple English (check synonyms, spelling, grammar, …)
* Let someone (fellow student) else read your text before you submit it
* Literature to be consulted optionally:
  - Scientific writing: Hengl, T. and Gould, M., 2002. Rules of thumb for writing research articles
  - Example of good LCA reporting: Hawkins, T.R., et al. (2013), Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles, J ind Ecol 17(1): 53 - 64

{{< hl-text orange>}}Proposal requirements{{< /hl-text >}}
* Max. 2000 words incl. 300 word abstract (excl. references)
* Problem statement (at least 2 LCA studies on your topic)
* Research aim (why is LCA the right tool?)
* Research question !!
* Method
  - 1 flowchart for each alternative (no copies from literature!)
  - Function, FU, alternatives, reference flow
* Data sources
* Discussion (possible difficulties and their solutions)
* Planning (including milestones etc.)

* Proposal is like a preliminary GSD
See also research proposal assignment, follow general report structure on the previous slide

{{< hl-text orange>}}Proposal challenges{{< /hl-text >}}
* Author name (also in the document name)
* Page numbers (!!)
* Captions (!!)
* Abbreviations with explanation
* Don’t forget a proper review of relevant LCA literature
* Structure of your story
* Avoiding extremely long sentences with difficult words (please, let someone else read your proposal before submitting)
* Avoid data collection via interviews (or if really needed: report the interview appropriately)
* Avoid using GWP as global warming, …etc.: terminology!!
* Choose a topic you understand, learning LCA is difficult enough
* Finding literature and referencing
* Project planning!!!

{{< hl-text orange>}}Final reporting requirements{{< /hl-text >}}
{{< hl-text orange>}}Mandatory final report structure{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Finally, …. once you are familiar with the basics of LCA, you may want to dive into ex-ante / prospective LCA in your thesis{{< /hl-text >}}

{{< hl-text orange>}}Don’t claim … prove; but how?{{< /hl-text >}}
* New technologies, chemicals, materials and products are proposed everyday
* Many claims are made:
  - “sustainable”, “safe”, “100% organic”, “green”, “recyclable”, “cradle2cradle”, “bio’, “bio-based”, “ecofriendly”, “natural”, ….
* However, don’t claim but prove first
  - Mostly used assessment method: environmental LCA
* LCA works perfectly for existing systems, with known specs, processes and data
(ex-post)
* But how can we use LCA for emerging technologies with unknown specs, processes and data?
* Upcoming: how can we use ex-ante RA and ex-ante LCA in combination to chemical safety issue (SSbD)
  - SSbD refers to designing new chemicals, materials, products and processes (technologies) while including safety right from the beginning of R&D

# 16. Jumpstarting your LCA case study
{{< hl-text orange>}}Canned or fresh pineapples?{{< /hl-text >}}
Is fresh the greener option?
* Grown in Costa Rica and the Philippines, consumed in The Netherlands;
* Of the fresh pineapple only 40-50% (by mass) can be eaten. So about half its weight is transported and then thrown away;
* Fresh pineapple needs to be transported at 7°C;
* Canned pineapple is more efficiently transported and has longer shelf life;
* Canned pineapple needs processing and canning

{{< hl-text orange>}}Data gathering{{< /hl-text >}}
* Starts in your research proposal (see that as preliminary GSD)
* Literature search and review
  - Google / scholar.google (also look for other LCA studies on pineapples)
  - Other search engines: f.e. web of science
  - Annual reports (Dole and other suppliers?)
  - ecoinvent (via CMLCA) and background reports
  - Other search terms (canned fruit?....)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Inventory phase{{< /hl-text >}}

* Background and foreground processes
* From general data (literature) to unit process data

{{< hl-text orange>}}Pineapple cultivation{{< /hl-text >}}
* Not in ecoinvent, assume no other process data available. Adjust existing ecoinvent process.
* As a proxy use sugar cane [BR] (P2700)
* What we do know
- 1000 kg pineapple / 100m2 => 1 kg pineapple / 0,1 m2

{{< hl-text orange>}}Can production (1){{< /hl-text >}}
* Cans are not in ecoinvent
* Search for data (provide references!)
* Model yourself. Simple Assumptions cans are made of aluminum, you need electricity to produce them and they are produced in a building.
* Pure hypothetical data
  - Factory produces 1.000.000 cans / year
  - Consumes 20.000 kWh electricity / year
  - Consumes 30 tons aluminium / year
  - Factory is 100 m2 with a lifetime is 20 years

{{< hl-text orange>}}Can production (2){{< /hl-text >}}
* Consumes 20.000 kWh electricity / year => 0,02 kWh electricity / can (G129)
* Consumes 30 tons aluminium / year => 0,03 kg aluminium / can (G17)
* Factory produces 1.000.000 cans / year, Factory is 100 m2 with lifetime of 20 years => 5 x 10-6 m2 of factory / can (G583)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Packaging{{< /hl-text >}}
* 50% by mass is transported rest is waste
* Needs pineapple (how much?)
* Needs a can (how many?)

{{< hl-text orange>}}Transport to consumer{{< /hl-text >}}
* Transport is defined as service in ecoinvent (f.e. disposal as well)
* Transport process => reference flow is [tkm]
  - transporting 1000 kg over 200 km = 200 tkm

[^in]: There are basically 2 options for modelling your own disposal process: 1) connecting a waste flow out to an ecoinvent waste process (and accepting its data); 2) defining a new disposal process managing your specific waste, calculating 3 emissions yourself applying chemical reactions and mass balancing (IN = OUT) fulfilling the “3 emissions calculation requirement” below, and optionally copying data on economic inflows like electricity and fuel needs from an existing similar ecoinvent process.
[^ec]: You cannot use the same process to fulfill the closed loop and the multifunctionality co-production requirements; you need separate processes for that. Closed loop also involves a multifunctional problem, but the solutions (either allocation or substitution) don’t change the results as will be/has been discussed in class. Therefore, you are also required to model a co-production process with at least one functional flow crossing the system boundary.
[^3ex]: Three extensions should be calculated yourself, not taking them from literature. The idea behind this requirement is that you calculate, e.g., some emission values yourself from just looking at the composition of an economic flow and making mass balances. For example, the incineration of a product containing C, S and Cd will lead to emissions of CO, CO2, SO2 and Cd that can be estimated using assumptions from literature and applying mass balance principles and chemical reaction equations.
