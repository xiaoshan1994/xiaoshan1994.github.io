# Bio
I am an Architectural Engineer and I have expertise in the built environment, sustainability, life cycle assessment, computer modelling and energy efficiency. My research focuses on life cycle environmental assessment and performance in the built environment, from construction materials to cities. I target practical research outcomes that have the potential to inform decision-making in the industry.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Architectural Engineering and Environmental Performance. In this position, I am developing/teaching new courses that tackle environmental performance across the scales of the built environment and focus on innovative construction techniques and design that integrates a dual architectural engineering approach. I inform my teaching by research and practical experience in Australia, Belgium and Lebanon.

The contribution of my work to the field of environmental assessment of the built environment has been acknowledged by 14 awards so far. I am also regularly invited as a referee for scientific publications in my field by top journals. In addition, I have acted as a consultant for regional governance bodies and professional organisations in Australia and Belgium as well as for the United Nations.

Expertise: Life cycle assessment, Computer modelling, Energy efficient buildings, Sustainable construction.

I am interested in supervising PhD candidates in the fields of life cycle environmental performance in the built environment and more specifically: embodied environmental flows, parametric modelling for environmental performance and urban material flows and stocks analysis.
