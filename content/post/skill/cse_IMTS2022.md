# Module 1 - Conceptual Framework
## Participants Manual Module 1
## Optional Non-evaluated Module 1 Quiz
1. What is the CIF value for this import transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the importing Country; C = destination. Import with Terms of delivery DDU 'C' (invoiced amount includes freight costs from the place of dispatch to the destination). Invoiced amount for two items: Invoiced value of item 1 (100 kg) is $1,500. Invoiced value of item 2 (50 kg) is $2,240. Total: $3,740. Total Freight costs from the border of the importing country to the destination are assumed to be $300.
The correct answer is: Item 2: $2,140
CIF counting: A to C
{{< hl-text orange>}}The rule to split the freight is the weight principle as standard freight pricing is based on weight rather than value.{{< /hl-text >}}

2. What is the FOB value for this export transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the exporting country; C = destination. Export with Terms of delivery DDU 'C' (invoiced amount includes freight costs from the place of dispatch to the destination). Total invoiced amount: $5,600. Calculated freight costs from the border of the exporting Country to C: $1,200.
The correct answer is: $4,400

3. What is the FOB value for this export transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the exporting country; C = border of the importing country; D = place of destination. Exports with EXW (ex-works, 工厂交货价) delivery terms (the invoiced amount excludes transport costs from the place of dispatch to the place of destination). Transport costs are proportional to the distance). Total amount billed: $5,600. Transportation costs from A to D: $2,000. Total distance = 2,000 km (distance A->B = 250 km, distance B->C = 1,000 km and distance C->D = 750 km).
The correct answer is: $5,850
{{< hl-text orange>}}For FOB, Only A to C counts. 5600+2000*(250/2000){{< /hl-text >}}

5. What is the CIF value for this import transaction? To = place of shipment; B = border of the exporting country; C = border of the importing country; D = place of destination. Imports with delivery conditions DDP (Delivered to the final place of destination including Duty Paid) (the invoiced amount includes the transport costs from the place of dispatch to the place of destination). Transport costs are proportional to the distance. Total amount billed: $5,200. Transportation costs from A to D: $2,000. Total distance = 2,000 km (distance A->B = 250 km, distance B->C = 1,000 km and distance C->D = 750 km).
The correct answer is: $4,450
{{< hl-text orange>}}For CIF, Only A to C counts. 5200-2000*(750/2000){{< /hl-text >}}
