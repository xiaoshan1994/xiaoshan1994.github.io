# Module 1 - Conceptual Framework
## Participants Manual Module 1
### 3. SCOPE AND TIME OF RECORDING
* As a general guideline, record {{< hl-text orange>}}all goods which add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory (para. 1.2). {{< /hl-text >}}
* Trade below customs and statistical thresholds: Estimate and include if economically significant (para. 1.3)
* Change of ownership: Use as criteria for recording of certain goods only in exceptional cases when the general guideline is not applicable or not sufficient (para. 1.4).
* Time of recording: As a general guideline, record goods at the time when they enter or leave the economic territory of a country (para. 1.8). In the case of customs-based data collection systems, this time can be frequently approximated by the date of lodgement of the customs declaration (para. 2.22).
* For IMTS 2010 purposes, {{< hl-text orange>}}any installation or equipment, mobile or not, located outside the geographical territory of a country, owned by the country resident(s) and remaining under the country’s jurisdiction, is treated as if it were a part of its economic territory. This applies, for example, to drilling rigs, ships, aircraft, space stations, etc.{{< /hl-text >}}

## Optional Non-evaluated Module 1 Quiz
1. What is the CIF value for this import transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the importing Country; C = destination. Import with Terms of delivery DDU 'C' (invoiced amount includes freight costs from the place of dispatch to the destination). Invoiced amount for two items: Invoiced value of item 1 (100 kg) is $1,500. Invoiced value of item 2 (50 kg) is $2,240. Total: $3,740. Total Freight costs from the border of the importing country to the destination are assumed to be $300.
{{< alert success >}}The correct answer is: Item 2: $2,140. CIF counting: A to C. The rule to split the freight is the weight principle as standard freight pricing is based on weight rather than value.{{< /alert >}}


2. What is the FOB value for this export transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the exporting country; C = destination. Export with Terms of delivery DDU 'C' (invoiced amount includes freight costs from the place of dispatch to the destination). Total invoiced amount: $5,600. Calculated freight costs from the border of the exporting Country to C: $1,200.
{{< alert success >}}The correct answer is: $4,400{{< /alert >}}

3. What is the FOB value for this export transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the exporting country; C = border of the importing country; D = place of destination. Exports with EXW (ex-works, 工厂交货价) delivery terms (the invoiced amount excludes transport costs from the place of dispatch to the place of destination). Transport costs are proportional to the distance). Total amount billed: $5,600. Transportation costs from A to D: $2,000. Total distance = 2,000 km (distance A->B = 250 km, distance B->C = 1,000 km and distance C->D = 750 km).
The correct answer is: $5,850
{{< alert success >}}For FOB, Only A to C counts. 5600+2000*(250/2000){{< /alert >}}

5. What is the CIF value for this import transaction? To = place of shipment; B = border of the exporting country; C = border of the importing country; D = place of destination. Imports with delivery conditions DDP (Delivered to the final place of destination including Duty Paid) (the invoiced amount includes the transport costs from the place of dispatch to the place of destination). Transport costs are proportional to the distance. Total amount billed: $5,200. Transportation costs from A to D: $2,000. Total distance = 2,000 km (distance A->B = 250 km, distance B->C = 1,000 km and distance C->D = 750 km).
{{< alert success >}}The correct answer is: $4,450. For CIF, Only A to C counts. 5200-2000*(750/2000){{< /alert >}}

6. A satellite is produced and launched in country B. The owner of the satellite is in country A. What is the appropriate treatment in trade statistics of country A?
{{< alert success >}}The correct answer is: import with value limited to the satellite (excluding the launcher)
{{< hl-text orange>}} All goods which add to or subtract from {{< hl-text blue>}}the stock of material resources of a country{{< /hl-text >}} by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its {{< hl-text blue>}}economic territory{{< /hl-text >}} (para. 1.2). Change of ownership: Use as criteria for recording of certain goods {{< hl-text blue>}}only in exceptional cases when the general guideline is not applicable or not sufficient{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /hl-text >}}.{{< /alert >}}

7. What is the CIF value for this import transaction? A = place of dispatch; B = border of the exporting country; C = border of importing country; D =destination. Import with Terms of delivery EXW 'A' (invoiced amount excludes freight costs from the place of dispatch to the destination). Total invoiced amount: $3,200. Commission costs = $240. Freight costs from A to D: $2,000. Total distance = 2,000 km (distance A->B = 500 km, distance B->C = 1,000 km and distance C->D = 500 km).
{{< alert success >}}The correct answer is: 4,940 {{< hl-text orange>}}The commission costs are counted within CIF.{{< /hl-text >}}{{< /alert >}}
