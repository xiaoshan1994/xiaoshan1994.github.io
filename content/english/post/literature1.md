### Highlights
#### Industry
* ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under the following circumstances.

  * when there is enough accessible, high-quality data around specific processes or transport routes.
  * when firms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with researchers and other firms.
  * When aspects of production or shipping can be readily fine-tuned or adjusted, and there are clear objective functions.
  * When firm's incentives align with reducing emissions(for example, through efficiency gains, regulatory compliance, or high GHG prices).

* Optimizing supply chains

ML may help reduce emissions in supply chains by intelligently predicting supply and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and optimizing shipping routes.

* Reducing overproduction
