*Since I'm here I couldn't count that how many times people asking me 'how are you' and I actually don't know how to response this due to the difference of the greeting ways.*

Today I came across Grace in the corridor of our apartment building. Again I was asking 'How are you?' It could be simple as a normal greeting way here but I just not be adapted to it. At the hometown we just say people's name if he/she is an acquaintance. Or maybe just one word meaning "good morning" could be enough. So just to avoid awkwardness, I have to do some work here.

* Easy responses
I'm fairly/really well.

* Interesting
never been better
so far, so good (about progress in a task)
can't complain! (depends on the tone of the voice)
Better than I deserve!

* 'Ok' (neither good or bad):
I am alright.(both questions and answers)
So so.
Not too bad.
could be better.
Same old, same old.
I am alive/I am surviving (just so close to being bad)
Good enough.

* Sarcastic responses:
I am alright now, but there's still time for everything to go horribly wrong.
Better now that I am talking to you. (really charming isn't it?)

* Negative ones
I'm not going to lie.. I feel terrible...
I'm not doing so well.
I'm struggling a bit.
I'm snowed under. (got too much work)
It's been a tough day/week/year.
I'm not having an easy time at this moment.

* Avoid the question
You don't want to know.
Don't ask.
Do I have to answer that.
It's too early to tell (morning)

* Funny ones
Overworked and underpaid.
