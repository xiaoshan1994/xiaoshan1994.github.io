*Since I'm here I couldn't count that how many times people asking me 'how are you' and I actually don't know how to response this due to the difference of the greeting ways.*

Today I came across Grace in the corridor of our apartment building. Again I was asking 'How are you?' It could be simple as a normal greeting way here but I just not be adapted to it. At the hometown we just say people's name if he/she is an acquaintance. Or maybe just one word meaning "good morning" could be enough. So just to avoid awkwardness, I have to do some work here.
