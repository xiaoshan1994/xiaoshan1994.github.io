Project: F-4-Z
Aim:
1. Building a detailed, spatially explicit, internationally trade linked **GMRIO of food and energy systems** at a **~5arc min(9km)** resolution.
2. Exploring **current environmental and social footprints** of these systems and the **threats or opportunities presented by EU net-zero strategies**.
3. Incorporating net-zero pathways from the literature into the model from both production and consumption perspectives, and connecting land suitability maps for future renewable energy, mining, and agriculture potentials.
4. Using **projected water and food yield maps** to identify important issues and opportunities for net-zero strategies.

EU net-zero strategies(including but not limited to): consumption shifts(transition to nationally recommended diets, plant-based diets, reduced consumer waste, and closing yield gaps) and co2 removal.
> About "[closing the yield gaps](https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/yieldsgaps)" given by European Commission.

The need for a high spatial resolution and supply-chain integrated model to fully assess EU net-zero strategies and pathways.

About "[closing the yield gaps](https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/yieldsgaps)" given by European Commission.
Currently, a coarse resolution at ~25acrmin. ---> we want to build a 5arcmin one.
