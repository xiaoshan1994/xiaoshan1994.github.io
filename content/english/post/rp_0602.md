Project: F-4-Z
Aim:
1. Building a detailed, spatially explicit, internationally trade linked **GMRIO of food and energy systems** at a **~5arc min(9km)** resolution.
2. Exploring **current environmental and social footprints** of these systems and the **threats or opportunities presented by EU net-zero strategies**.
3. Incorporating net-zero pathways from the literature into the model from both production and consumption perspectives, and connecting land suitability maps for future renewable energy, mining, and agriculture potentials.
4. Using **projected water and food yield maps** to identify important issues and opportunities for net-zero strategies.

## Research route

1. To avoid environmental damage, the food and energy systems urgently need transition. EU net-zero strategies(including but not limited to): consumption shifts(transition to nationally recommended diets, plant-based diets, reduced consumer waste, and closing yield gaps) and co2 removal.

2. Proposed net-zero strategies will have enormous impacts across nations and continents as EU engages in larger net-imports of resources and emissions than any other continents.

3. Local conditions are key to identifying net-zero trade-offs and opportunities
  * large changes in land use like land sparing/sharing, biodiversity preservation and synergistic renewable energy development aligned with other net-zero targets
  * Natural climate solutions and carbon sequestration opportunities in the sparing land. Land and mining requirements for renewable energy.)

4. Therefore we need a high-spatial resolution and a supply-chain integrated model to fully assess EU net-zero strategies and pathways.
  * Disadvantages of current land-use models:  
    a coarse resolution at ~25arcmin (45km);
    limited number of regions;
    omit socioeconomic factors (focusing overwhelmingly on price optimization);
    not connected to international supply chains.
  *  GMRIOs can trace teleconnection(environmental and social impacts) international supply chains, but they are available at a national level only and with limited product detail in food systems.
  * Already some work done on spatially explicit approaches for liking supply chains and physical national IOTs with a high product resolution.

The need for a high spatial resolution and supply-chain integrated model to fully assess EU net-zero strategies and pathways.

About "[closing the yield gaps](https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/yieldsgaps)" given by European Commission.
Currently, a coarse resolution at ~25acrmin. ---> we want to build a 5arcmin one.
