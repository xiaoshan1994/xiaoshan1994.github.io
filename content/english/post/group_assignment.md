Many British businesses, along with the UK operations of multinationals, depend heavily on imports from the European Union (EU) and are closely integrated with EU-based suppliers.

The EU is the UK’s largest trading partner, accounting for approximately half of both imports and exports of goods.

Trading ties with the EU are of particular importance to UK-based firms in the food and drink, chemicals, and automotive sectors.

Trade in these inputs is vulnerable to disruption from Brexit,  as they would all face relatively high duties if their tade relationship goes back to the WTO most-favoured nation status.

## Taking a look at Brexit Supply Chain Challenges—Dual Tariffs, Dual Operations

Q: Many companies in the U.K. are experiencing challenges exporting goods to the European Union (EU) and are therefore looking to establish warehouses and distribution centers on EU territory. Can you explain why this is happening?

A:This is primarily driven by the **delays at customs** and the challenges with **dual tariffs**. Dual tariffs are coming into play if you are bringing your product into the U.K. from outside the EU and then re-exporting to the EU. This can result in tariffs both on import - and again once you re-export to the EU. This is leading many transport companies to by-pass the U.K land-bridge and instead move product from Ireland to the EU to avoid delays and customs checks.
