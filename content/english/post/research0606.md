Identifying production hotspots for global crop and livestock consumption by a Spatially Explicit Multi-Reginal Input-Output model([Zhongxiao's work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912419300276) on Global Food Security).

Keywords: primary crops; animal husbandry; spatially explicit; Multi-Regional Input-Output(MRIO) analysis.


##ã€€Current limitations
1. Many studies only focus on crops while the distribution of livestock has been examined in this paper.
2. No comprehensive assessment of crops and livestock embodied in trade at a high spatial resolution since.

## Story line

1. Food security is challenged by increasing global food demand driven by population growth and animal-based diets.
2. More agricultural production requires increasing areas of land and fresh water, causing associated environmental impacts[^1].
[^1]: e.g. Eutrophication, soil acidification, ecotoxicity, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity loss.
3.
