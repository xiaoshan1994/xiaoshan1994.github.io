Identifying production hotspots for global crop and livestock consumption by a Spatially Explicit Multi-Reginal Input-Output model ( *[Zhongxiao's work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912419300276)* on *Global Food Security*).

Keywords: primary crops; animal husbandry; spatially explicit; Multi-Regional Input-Output(MRIO) analysis.

## Research background

1. Food security is challenged by increasing global food demand driven by population growth and animal-based diets.
2. More crop production requires increasing areas of land and fresh water, causing associated environmental impacts[^1].
3. Also livestock should be a focus as their feed contains harmful ingredients[^2] which will released to our environment finally.
4. To preserve nature, high-income nations transfer this **environmental burden** to agriculture producing countries through **international trade**.
5. Two classical examples of shifting environmental burdens through international trade are the export of Brazilian soy and Indonesian palm oil, acting as case studies in this paper.
6. As no comprehensive assessment of crops and livestock embodied in trade **at a high spatial resolution** since, this work has been done, expecting to guide sustainable practices and healthier diets [^3] as well as facilitate global cooperation between production- and consumption-oriented countries [^4].
7. This work also facilitates a more accurate assessment of agricultural environment impacts in EXIOBASE.
[^1]: e.g. Eutrophication, soil acidification, ecotoxicity, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity loss.
[^2]: Livestock feed potentially contains additives, antibiotics and antimicrobials, leading eutrophication, soil contamination and the spread of drug-resistant pathogens.
[^3]: By identifying **spatial heterogeneity of different consumption patterns** and setting **a safe target** for primary crops and livestock consumption.
[^4]: With consumption-based accounting of primary crops and livestock.
