Thoughts on investigating global/national inequality and production along supply chains.

Background: Inequality is one of social pressures.
Question:
1. Inequality refers to the income inequality in this case?

Thoughts: Then, related indicators maybe Gini index or ratios (10/40 or 20/20, income shares of the richest percentage to that of the poorest).

2. What kinds of commodities in the supply chain are more likely to cause a larger income inequality? or we focus on what products in the research?

Thoughts: Exported products. Or maybe mineral products regarding the energy transaction in the future? As we have maps of mining sites for local and the trade flows of these products in IO tables. Also it's better to scale down to specific minerals (eg. lithium for electric cars) and it may depend on the geospatial data in these sourcing countries (Chile, ).   

3. How to make sure it is the production or the resource extraction for export rather than other factors that cause the potential change of the local peopleâ€™s income?

Thoughts: There are a lot of factors can affect local people's income. It seems not reasonable if we directly map production to inequality.
