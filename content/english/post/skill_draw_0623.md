## Setting nudge distance/keyboard increment

{{< youtube qG46R-U0Hhs >}}

1. Uncheck *snap to pixel* in the *view tab*
2. Change the *keyboard increment* in the *Edit tab* ->*preference* from 1 pixel(by fault) to a tiny one which you want.
3. Tip also: the super nudge is a 10-times shift by holding the *shift* when using the arrow key.
