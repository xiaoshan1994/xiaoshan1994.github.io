Almost every overview of LCA gives a graphical indication of the idea of a life cycle. Such diagrams consist of a linear sequence or network of blocks, connected with arrows, representing the major life stages of a product life cycle. Examples from recent textbooks on LCA can be found in Klöpffer and Grahl (2014, p. 2), Jolliet et al. (2016, p. 36), and Hauschild et al. (2018, p. 120). **All such flow diagrams agree on the basic setup of a chronological order: resource becomes products, products are used, and it all ends with disposal of waste**.

Yet, some of the databases for LCA tell a different story. In this paper, we focus on the ecoinvent database, a popular source of LCI data. We do not rule out that our analysis is also applicable to some other databases, but we did not analyse these.

In the methodology report for ecoinvent v2 (Frischknecht et al. 2004), it is stated that **waste disposal processes “deliver the service of waste treatment.”** Practically, this means that there is not a flow of waste from a waste generating process to a disposal process (Fig. 1a), but a flow of the service of waste treatment from a disposal process to a waste generating process (Fig. 1b). In the current version of ecoinvent (v3), this setup has been maintained, with one modification: the reference product of a disposal activity delivers a negative amount of “material for treatment” (Weidema et al. 2013). Probably, a main reason for this change in ecoinvent version 3 was to solve the flawed mass balance of the waste producing activity (i.e., the use process in Fig. 1a). Indeed, if we check the data, we see that these processes have the name of a disposal activity, but the reference product has the name of the waste, not of the service. For instance, the unit process “direct disposal of wastewater from textile production” has a negative input flow of “wastewater from textile production”. This setup is sketched in Fig. 1c.
