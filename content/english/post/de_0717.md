It's great here. Have had **unbroken sunshine** ever since we arrived. We're having a wonderful time-though in the middle of the day it's just too scorching hot to do anything but lie on the beach soaking up the sunshine. This is the life!

It's been pouring with rain all day. In fact I've never seen such torrential rain! It's freezing cold in the tent-we all got soaked. Every half hour we look out of the tent hoping for a break in the clouds. In vain! We're going to a hotel next year!

It rained heavily all day yesterday but it's dry at the moment. There's thick cloud, though, and it certainly looks like rain. Quite a strong wind is blowing too! Am glad we brought warm clothes!
