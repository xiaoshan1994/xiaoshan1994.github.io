## Cards

It's great here. Have had **unbroken sunshine** ever since we arrived. We're having a wonderful time-though in the middle of the day it's just too scorching hot to do anything but lie on the beach soaking up the sunshine. This is the life!

It's been pouring with rain all day. In fact I've never seen such torrential rain! It's freezing cold in the tent-we all got soaked. Every half hour we look out of the tent hoping for a break in the clouds. In vain! We're going to a hotel next year!

It rained heavily all day yesterday but it's dry at the moment. There's thick cloud, though, and it certainly looks like rain. Quite a strong wind is blowing too! Am glad we brought warm clothes!
## Weather conditions

The weather is likely to deteriorate later on today.

There is ***thick fog*** on the motorway.
There are ***pathes of fog*** on the east coast but these should lift by midday.
> Patches of fog/mist are small areas of fog/mist, whereas a blanket of fog/mist is thicker and more extensive.

Avoid going on the beach at midday when the sun is strongest.

Road conditions are difficult because of the driving rain.
> driving rain = rain falling fast and heavily.

The snow is lovely and crisp this morning.
> crisp snow = snow that is fresh and hard.

There will be a hard frost tonight.
> opposite of a hard frost = a light frost (NOT a soft frost)

The ***wind*** was ***light*** this morning but it's ***picking up*** now and will be very strong by the evening. The wind was ***whistling*** through the trees.
> biting winds = very cold winds If the wind picks up, it gets stronger.

## Extreme Weather

Freak stroms devastate SW

Yesterday ***freak weather conditions hit*** the south-west of England. ***Gale-force winds*** caused a lot of damage to property. A number of buildings were destroyed, ***roofs were torn off*** and ***fences were blown down***. Several rivers ***burst their banks***.
