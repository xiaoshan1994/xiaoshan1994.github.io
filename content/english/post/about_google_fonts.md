Thanks to [Damien](https://damien.co/blog/2020-06-20-use-custom-fonts-typography-hugo-shortcode/).
I got new hugo shortcodes for the
fonts update in this website.

Google Fonts is a great library of free fonts that you can use
on your sites.

Normally, you have to edit a bunch of
html files with repeated codes - but now
you only need to make a hugo shortcode
and save it in your `layouts/shortcodes` file.

 The code script for my site:

 ```md
{{ $font := .Get "font" }}
{{ $size := .Get "size" }}
{{ $style := .Get "style" | default "normal" }}
{{ $weight := .Get "weight" | default "normal" }}
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family={{$font }}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<div style="font-family:'{{ $font }}'; font-size:{{ $size }}; font-style:{{ $style}}; font-weight:{{ $weight }}">
    {{- .Inner -}}
</div>
```
How to use it
```md
{{</* gfont font="font-family" size="36px" weight="bold" */>}}
You are awesome. You're even better!
{{</* /gfont */>}}
```
You can customize the shortcode name which should be the same with the file name (without extension). Pay attention to the the closing part `{{/* gfont */}}`.

Here are some examples I hope to deploy in this blog site:

For posts of the daily life (`Pattaya`and `Courgette`):

```md
{{</* gfont font="Pattaya" size="30px" */>}}
Pattaya is a city in Thailand.<br>A beach resort popular with tourists.
{{</* /gfont */>}}
{{</* gfont font="Courgette" size="15px" */>}}
Courgette works well in smaller sizes and even in text.
{{</* /Courgette */>}}
```
{{< gfont font="Pattaya" size="30px" >}}
Pattaya is a city in Thailand
{{< /gfont >}}

{{< gfont font="Courgette" size="15px" >}}
Courgette is a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface. The genre is traditionally used at large sizes but Courgette was carefully made for the web, with low stroke contrast that works well in smaller sizes and even in text.
{{< /gfont >}}

For **English learning posts** (`Pattaya` and `Courgette`):
 ```md
 {{</* gfont font="Pattaya" size="30px" */>}}
 Pattaya is a city in Thailand.<br>A beach resort popular with tourists.
 {{</* /gfont */>}}
 {{</* gfont font="Courgette" size="15px" */>}}
 Courgette works well in smaller sizes and even in text.
 {{</* /Courgette */>}}
 ```

{{< gfont font="Pattaya" size="30px" >}}
Pattaya is a city in Thailand
{{< /gfont >}}


{{< gfont font="Courgette" size="15px" >}}
Courgette is a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface. The genre is traditionally used at large sizes but Courgette was carefully made for the web, with low stroke contrast that works well in smaller sizes and even in text.
{{< /gfont >}}

For types of literature or technology(`Roboto`)
