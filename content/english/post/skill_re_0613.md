You will only be able to edit the style if the style is saved to your computer.

* Go to Tools - Output styles - select the style to edit.
* Select **Citations** to view how the **intext citation** displays and make any changes.
* Select **Bibliography** - Templates to view the templates for the different reference types and make changes.

Most of changes would be made in these places.

When you close the style window, you will be prompted to save changes you have made. If you wish to save the style with a new name, click File - Save As. Name the new style.  You will need to select the new style from the Output Style drop down menu and Select Another Style.

There are special characters or 'fields' with which EndNote controls how records appear in the bibliography. Place your cursor where you want the character in the template. Go to **Insert Field** on the right and select the appropriate character:

* Singular/plural (^ caret symbol) - used if there is different text for singular/plural forms e.g. (Ed.),^(Eds.)

* Link adjacent text - a non-breaking space (shown as a small grey diamond in the template) used to link adjacent text to a field so text doesn't appear if the field is empty.

* Forced separation (| pipe symbol)- used to separate punctuation from adjacent fields. e.g. you might want a full stop at the end no matter what fields are empty.

* Field names as literal text (`back apostrophe symbol)- used if you want text in your records that has already been used as a field name e.g. if you want the word 'year' as well as the field year.

* To remove a field - Highlight > click Delete on your keyboard.

* To substitute fields select Bibliography > Field Substitutions and tick the appropriate boxes e.g. the URL field can be inserted for records without a DOI.
