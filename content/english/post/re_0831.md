# Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```
* Tuple items are **ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values**.
  - When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
  - Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that ***we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created***.
  - Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value
* Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Tuple items can be String, int and boolean data types
```
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
```
# List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets:
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
* List items are **ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values**.
  - List items have a defined order
  - The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created
  - Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value
* List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
* List items can be String, int and boolean data types.
