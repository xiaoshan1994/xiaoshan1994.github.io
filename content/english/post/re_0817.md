## Nature-based solutions and scenarios

Nature-based Solutions (BbS) are actions that enable the protection, sustainable management and restoration of natural and managed ecosystems, that can simultaneously provide human well-being an biodiversity benefits.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) include restoration, management, and rehabilitation measures, as well as conservation of ecosystems, that enhance natureâ€™s contribution to people, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, assisted natural regeneration and urban green and blue spaces.

There is now increased attention on these solutions as they have the potential to address many global sustainable development challenges simultaneously, from environmental to socio-economic to health challenges.

NbS can help generate multiple benefits for society, such as food and water security, climate mitigation and adaptation, while addressing biodiversity loss. This is their unique selling point. NbS can therefore contribute towards the achievement of many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) simultaneously, including in particular, climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15), zero hunger (SDG2) and clean water and sanitation (SDG6), alongside many others.

Nature-based solutions and their use in practice are becoming increasingly recognised in international policy discussions.

Nature-based solutions and their use in practice are becoming increasingly recognised in international policy discussions.
The rapid growth in policy interest for NbS has culminated in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), following on from recent restoration ambitions such as the Bonn Challenge, that aims to restore 350 million ha of degraded land by 2030. Nature-based solutions are central to the new CBD Global Biodiversity framework for 2021-2030, the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, Land Degradation Neutrality Targets and multiple SDGs. Fortunately, many types of these solutions are already happening on the ground.

The need for action and impact on the ground is accelerating. Scenarios are a tool that can help to link global level policy frameworks to local level action and vice versa.

Scenarios are a tool that can help policymakers chart possible future pathways, to realise the potential of nature-based solutions and restoration for multiple societal and environmental benefits and contribute towards achieving multiple international goals, such as the SDGs.

## Global perspective

Assessing potential future environmental changes helps policymakers decide where to take action and understand what the effects of policy can be. PBL uses scenarios and computer models to explore such future pathways.

Scenarios are storylines and assumptions on potential future developments, and models use these to project future developments. Projections are presented in maps and graphs.

Three scenarios are used to show the impact of future developments:

* Business-as-usual: a baseline scenario that includes assumptions on future land degradation
* Restoration: a scenario that includes restoration, improved land management measures, and protection of key ecosystems
* "Sharing the Planet": A broader portfolio of transformative action towards achieving the SDGs

1. The problem: if current trends continue, global environmental problems will worsen with some regions being impacted more than others.

The pressure on land and ecosystems is growing in many regions of the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South America. This is mainly due to the increasing demand for arable crops, meat and dairy products, bio-energy and timber, while land degradation and climate change impacts continue to accelerate. Such impacts have huge consequences for ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and the resilience of ecological and human systems.

### Trends in land and climate

land use change: between 2015 and 2050, under the baseline scenario, land use is projected to continue to increase, with **agriculture and pasture land** expanding at the cost of remaining natural areas, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Indicator:
* Deforestation and conversion of other natural land (% change per grid cell)
* Reforestation and abandonment of agricultural to other natural land (% change per grid cell)

Land degradation: Land degradation is shown by ***long-term trends in the biomass productivity of ecosystems***, through **normalised difference vegetation index** (2001-2018, corrected for climate change). NDVI is key indicator of land degradation in the Sustainable Development Goals.
Indicator:
* Annual % change in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)


Climate change: Climate change affects land use and the condition of land and biodiversity, with the largest temperature changes (2015-2050) expected in northern regions.
Indicator:
* Degrees Celsius

Main conclusions:
Projected increase in cropland and pastureland 430 million ha;
Land-use change in sub-Saharan Africa around 200 million ha;
Global land area with a long-term negative trend in productivity 7-10%
