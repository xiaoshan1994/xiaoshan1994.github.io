Sacha Baron Cohen denounces Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google as 'the greatest propaganda machine in history' and culpable for a surge in 'murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities'. The actor focuses on Facebook, saying that 'if you pay them, the platform will run any "political" ad you want, even if it's a lie'. Baron Cohen is speaking on Thursday at Never Is Now, the Anti-Defamation League’s summit on antisemitism and hate in New York, where he is presented with the organisation’s international leadership award.

democracy which depends on shared

truths is in retreat and autocracy

which depends on shared lies is on the

march

hate crimes are surging as a murderous

attacks on religious and ethnic

minorities

now what do all these dangerous trends

have in common

i'm just a comedian and an actor i'm not

a scholar but one thing

is pretty clear to me all this hate

and violence is being facilitated by a

handful of internet companies

that amount to the greatest propaganda

machine

in history

the algorithms these platforms depend on

deliberately amplify the type of content

that keeps users engaged

stories that appeal to our baser

instincts

and that trigger outrage and fear it's

why

youtube recommended videos by the

conspiracist alex jones

billions of times it's why fake news

outperforms real news because studies

show that

lies spread faster than truth and it's

no surprise that the greatest propaganda

machine in history

has spread the oldest conspiracy theory

in history

the lie that jews are somehow dangerous

as one headline put it just think what

goebbels could have done with facebook

zuckerberg

tried to portray this whole issue as

choices

around free expression that is ludicrous

this is not about limiting anyone's free

speech

this is about giving people including

some of the most reprehensible

people on earth the biggest platform in

history to reach a third of the planet

freedom of speech is not freedom of

reach

sadly there will always be racist

misogynist anti-semites and child

abusers

but i think we can all agree that we

should not be giving bigots and

pedophiles

a free platform to amplify their views

and target their victims

zuckerberg speaks of welcoming a

diversity of ideas

and last year he gave us an example he

said that he found

post denying the holocaust deeply

offensive

but he didn't think facebook should take

them down because

i think there are things that different

people get wrong

we have unfortunately millions of pieces

of evidence for the holocaust

it is an historical fact

and denying it is not some random

opinion

those who deny the holocaust aim to

encourage

another one if you pay them facebook

will run

any political ad you want even if it's a

lie

and they'll even help you micro target

those lies to their users

for maximum effect under this twisted

logic

if facebook were around in the 1930s it

would have allowed hitler to post 30

second ads on his solution

to the jewish problem so here's a good

standard

and practice facebook

start fact checking political ads before

you run them stop micro targeted lies

immediately and when the ads are false

give

back the money and don't publish them
