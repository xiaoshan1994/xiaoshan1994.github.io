Get is a very common verb in English, but it is not always appropriate for talking about changes. Note
also alternatives to get which can improve your style.

## Go, not get

* *People go mad/bald/grey/blind/deaf*.

> Go is often used for sudden, usually negative, changes:

* *He was very embarrassed and his face went red.*

> Go can also be used for slower colour changes:

* *The pages of the book had gone yellow over the years.*

## Turn, not get
> Turn often collocates with colours:

* *The sky turned gold as the sun set.*

* *The news gave his mother such a shock that her hair turned white overnight.*

## Get and become
> Get and become can often be used with the same collocations, but become is more formal and is therefore more appropriate in essays:

* *She gave up smoking when she became pregnant.*

* *I would like to become involved in raising money for charity.*

> The same is true for collocations with adjectives such as angry, bored, excited, depressed, upset,
impatient, violent:

* *He became depressed after his wife’s death.*

## Alternatives to get and become

* *She **fell ill** and was taken to hospital.*

* *Everyone **fell silent** when they heard the shocking news.*

* *As my father **grew older**, he spent less time working.*

* *The noise **grew louder** and soon we realised it was a plane approaching.*
