This is probably the most famous and recognizable form of head lettuce. Iceberg lettuce is also sometimes referred to as crisphead, and it is a pale green leafy vegetable that forms into a tight cabbage style head.

Iceberg lettuce is typically defined by its **mild flavor and crisp texture**. It gets a bad reputation in the nutrition industry for not being as nutritious as, say, romaine. But that doesn’t mean iceberg is without its benefits. With just two cups of iceberg lettuce you can consume more than 10% of your daily Vitamin B.

### BUTTERHEAD LETTUCE

As the name implies, butterhead lettuce is a head lettuce. Boston lettuce and Bibb lettuce make up this variety. They form heads, but they are more loose than iceberg. Boston lettuce is often described as looking a lot like a rose when it is flowering, whereas Bibb lettuce is smaller and more cup shaped.

The coloring of butterhead lettuce is typically the same green as that of grass. The texture is **soft and buttery**, which is where this lettuce gets its name.

Butterhead lettuces are more expensive than most other varieties and come **with their roots still attached and submerged in water**. They make up for their expense with a long shelf life, with some varieties remaining fresh for up to a month or more as long as their roots remain wet.

### ROMAINE LETTUCE

Romaine can also be considered a head lettuce, but its head is long and in the shape of a loaf. Variations of romaine vary with some having an open head and others a more closed appearance.

Romaine is very nutritious and is most commonly used in **Caesar salads** or our favorite Caesar Salad Summer Rolls over on our sister site Cook the Story. The taste of romaine lettuce is strong, but it doesn’t **overpower**. The texture of this lettuce is very crisp and it is one of the most nutritious lettuces in existence.

You can receive 7% of your daily fiber intake from one serving of romaine lettuce. It also contains quite a bit of folate, iron, manganese and potassium. As for vitamins, you can get 34% of your daily recommended value of Vitamin C from one serving of romaine, 109% of Vitamin K and a whopping 148% of your Vitamin A intake.
