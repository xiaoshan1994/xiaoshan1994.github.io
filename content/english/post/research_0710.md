Businesses, consumers, and shareholders demand robust data on climate, biodiversity, and resource footprints to inform their economic decisions:

* Microsoft’s carbon-negative pledge
* Nestle’s blockchain-based supply-chain transparency platform
* Black Rock’s decision to integrate climate risk into investment analysis

Latest **satellite sensor technologies** and **hyperspectral image-processing approaches** can deliver high-resolution and almost real-time information on a wide range of ecosystem changes on a worldwide scale:

* crop type and productivity
* urban and road expansion
* seasonal availability of surface water
* deforestation and biodiversity loss

A game changer when integrating spatially explicit supply-chain information into financial dashboards:

* Assess **impact hot-spots** within complete supply-chain footprints
* Choose **cost-effective interventions** to decrease environmental-impact profile
* Evaluate **investment risk**

Information theory combining multiple layers of spatially explicit model:

* Maximum-entropy models
* Bayesian methods

Examples for this approach:
* Linking supply chains to global biodiversity hotspots [^1]
* Mapping supply chains of tropical-forest risk commodities and their embedded deforestation with company-level detail (https://trase.earth/)
