"From Satellite to Supply Chain: New Approaches Connect Earth Observation to Economic Decisions"
Businesses, consumers, and shareholders demand robust data on climate, biodiversity, and resource footprints to inform their economic decisions:

* Microsoft’s carbon-negative pledge
* Nestle’s blockchain-based supply-chain transparency platform
* Black Rock’s decision to integrate climate risk into investment analysis

Latest **satellite sensor technologies** and **hyperspectral image-processing approaches** can deliver high-resolution and almost real-time information on a wide range of ecosystem changes on a worldwide scale:

* crop type and productivity
* urban and road expansion
* seasonal availability of surface water
* deforestation and biodiversity loss
