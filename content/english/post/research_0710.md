To help businesses and governments realize more sustainable supply chains, new approaches are using spatial data and machine-learning techniques to connect Earth observation data to conventional economic tools[^1].

Businesses, consumers, and shareholders demand robust data on climate, biodiversity, and resource footprints to inform their economic decisions:

* Microsoft’s carbon-negative pledge;
* Nestle’s blockchain-based supply-chain transparency platform;
* Black Rock’s decision to integrate climate risk into investment analysis.

Latest **satellite sensor technologies** and **hyperspectral image-processing approaches** can deliver high-resolution and almost real-time information on a wide range of ecosystem changes on a worldwide scale:

* Crop type and productivity;
* Urban and road expansion;
* Seasonal availability of surface water;
* Deforestation and biodiversity loss.

A game changer when integrating spatially explicit supply-chain information into financial dashboards:

* Assess **impact hot-spots** within complete supply-chain footprints;
* Choose **cost-effective interventions** to decrease environmental-impact profile;
* Evaluate **investment risk**.

Information theory combining multiple layers of spatially explicit model:

* Maximum-entropy models;
* Bayesian methods.

Examples for this approach:

* Linking supply chains to global biodiversity hotspots[^2];
* Mapping supply chains of tropical-forest risk commodities and their embedded deforestation with company-level detail[^3];
* Europe's raw-material footprint and related global impacts[^4];
* Industrial Ecology Virtual Lab[^5].

**Industrial-specific initiatives** for supply-chain transparency *at the producer end* (such as the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) are valuable.

*At the consumption end* of supply chains, a growing share of many countries’ environmental and social impacts occurs abroad.

*Individual consumers* too are increasingly asking for the locations and magnitude of the impacts associated with their choices.

Better supply-chain transparency can enable an accountability framework that triggers the adoption of higher environmental and social standards in producing regions.
