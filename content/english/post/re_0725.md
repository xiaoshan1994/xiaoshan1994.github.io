* Within this economically managed part of the energy sector, renewable energy sources currently provide about **25%** of the energy supplied.

* A large part of this renewable energy is in the form of **biomass energy**, either in food crops or in managed forestry providing wood for industrial purposes or for incineration[^in].

* There are two ways to harness solar energy. **Passive systems** are structures whose design, placement, or materials optimize the use of heat or light directly from the sun. **Active systems** have devices to convert the sunâ€™s energy into a more usable form, such as hot water or electricity[^ele].





[^in]: Firewood used for heat and cooking in poor countries or for mood-setting fireplaces in affluent countries, residue and waste burning in combined power and heat plants or incinerators.
[^ele]: (https://www.eesi.org/topics/solar/description). Installing south facing windows, planting shade trees and using Trombe walls, etc.
