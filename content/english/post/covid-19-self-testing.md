> These kits are only designed for human use．
> Use a separate test kit for each person. You can only use each item in　the test kit once. Do not re-use the items．

Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes before doing the test to
reduce the risk of spoiling the test.

## What you need to do
1. Prepare your test area and check your test kit contents
2. Set up your test
3. Take your swab sample
4. Process the swab sample
5. Read your result
6. Report your result
7. Safely dispose of your test kit

> Store the test kit at room temperature or in a cool dry place (2°C
to 30°C). Do not leave in direct sunlight and do not store in a
fridge or freezer.

### Prepare your test area and check your test kit contents
* Read this instruction guide carefully
* Clear, clean and dry a flat surface immediately before starting the test.
* Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds, using soap and warm water, or hand sanitiser. This is so that you do not contaminate the test kit. Now dry your hands.
* Check the test kit contents. Make sure that nothing is damaged or broken.

### Set up your test
* Take the test strip out of the sealed packaging and place it onto the cleaned flat
surface. Once opened, start the test within 30 minutes.

  > Safely throw away the inner desiccant bag and packaging in your household waste.
* Carefully twist or snap open the sachet. Open it away from your face and be careful not to spill any of the liquid.
* Open the extraction tube and gently squeeze all of the liquid from the buffer
sachet into the tube. Avoid touching the sachet against the tube. Place extraction buffer sachet in the plastic waste bag provided.
* Place the filled tube in the extraction tube holder (attached inside the box) to
avoid spilling the liquid.
* Gently blow your nose into a tissue and throw the tissue away in a closed bin.
If you are testing a child help them to blow their nose. This is so that you get rid of
excess mucus.
* Wash your hands thoroughly again for 20 seconds using soap and warm water (or use
sanitiser).
* Find the swab in the sealed wrapper in front of you. Identify the soft, fabric tip of
the swab.
* Peel open the swab packaging only when you are ready to use and gently take out the
swab. You'll use this for both throat and nose.

### Take your swab sample

> Do not touch the tongue, teeth, cheeks, gums, or any other
surfaces with the fabric tip of the swab. If it touches anything
else, it may spoil your sample.
> Never touch the fabric strip with your hands.
> Taking the sample may cause gagging and minor discomfort, but it
should not hurt.

* Holding the swab between your fingers,
open your mouth wide and rub the fabric
tip of the swab over both tonsils (or where they would have been). Do this with firm contact 4 times on each side (use a torch or a mirror to help you do this). Carefully remove the swab from the back of your throat.
* Put the same swab gently into 1 nostril until you feel a slight resistance (about 2.5cm up
your nose). Roll the swab firmly around the inside of the nostril, making 10 complete circles. This may feel uncomfortable. Do not insert the swab any deeper if you feel strong resistance or pain.
* Pick up the extraction tube and place the fabric tip of the swab into the extraction tube so it is in
the liquid. Press the tip against the edge of the extraction tube with force, while rotating it around the extraction tube for 15 seconds. This is to transfer your sample into the liquid.
* Pinch the extraction tube against the swab as you remove it. Make sure you remove all liquid from the soft tip of the swab. Place the swab in the plastic waste bag provided.
* Press the cap tightly on to the extraction tube to avoid any leaks.
* Gently squeeze the extraction tube to place 2 drops of the liquid onto the specimen well (S) on the test strip. Make sure that you are dropping liquid and not an air bubble.
Put the extraction tube in the plastic waste bag along with the swab.
* Check the time and set a timer if you have one. Wait 30 minutes before you read
your result.
Waiting the full 30-minute development
time before you read your result is
very important.
A positive result can appear at any time after 20 minutes, however you must wait for the full 30 minutes to record a negative result as the test
line (T) may take this long to appear.
Find out how to read and report your result on the next page.
