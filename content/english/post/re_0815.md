## Abstract

Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, **economic allocation** is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a 'cookbook' with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step. The guidelines for allocation largely remained at the level of principles. This restricted elaboration of economic allocation may hamper application in practice. Therefore, this paper elaborates some examples applying economic allocation.

Method. Two concepts are of particular importance when applying economic allocation: **functional flow** and **multi-functional process**. The definitions of these concepts are presented and discussed. The basic principle of economic allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds [^pro]. Proceeds are based on prices and these are not always easy to determine for a process. A summary of possible solutions for
different problems when determining prices is given.

Results and Discussion. The examples presented focus on **coproduction** and various **recycling situations**. All examples are hypothetical in order to avoid discussions on the data. The examples show that the prices of the functional flows determine the allocation results. It is of importance to have correct information on the relative prices of the functional flows at stake, especially whether they are negative or positive. Learning from these examples, we establish a decision tree for economic allocation. The decision tree is meant for identifying and handling multi-functionality situations starting from a defined (product) system. This decision tree is with minor adaptations also applicable to other allocation methods and has a more general value than for the economic allocation method only.

Conclusions and perspective. The examples have helped us to establish a decision tree for handling the multi-functionality problem by economic allocation. The examples can be broadened to other materials and allocation situations. We would encourage others to provide other examples and experiences as we expect that these will help to further improve and refine the guidelines and decision tree for economic allocation in future.

## 1 Goal, Scope and Background

Economic allocation is one recognised way of systematically executing allocation in LCA. ISO gives this option in step 3 of its allocation procedure (ISO 1998). However, how exactly this economic allocation is to be done has remained unspecified, or at least for many practitioners the choices to be made, and their consequences are still unclear. In the recently published Dutch Handbook on LCA (Guin6e et al. 2002), we worked out the principles for economic allocation in a section dedicated to multi-functionality and allocation[^alloca]. In the Handbook, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. In this method, for example, the share of each product in total sales of a process is considered to indicate its share in the full existence of that process.

Whereas the general ambition of the Handbook on LCA was to provide a 'cookbook' with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this aim was not completely achieved for the allocation step; it remained at the level of principles. Due to this restricted elaboration of economic allocation step, it may hamper application in practice. Therefore, this paper elaborates some examples applying economic allocation according to the above mentioned Handbook on LCA. Learning from these examples, we establish a decision tree for economic allocation. This decision tree is - with minor adaptations - also applicable to other allocation methods and has a more general value than for the economic allocation method only.

The purpose of this paper is thus not to discuss economic allocation in all it appearances (e.g. Werner and Richter 2000; Vogtlander et al. 2001) but rather to illustrate one specific method of economic allocation - viz. economic allocation according to the Dutch Handbook on LCA - with educational examples. We don't discuss the uncertainties attached to this specific method in depth. As recommended in the Handbook sensitivity analyses always remain necessary for allocation, since it is impossible to have an ultimate best solution accepted by everybody for a problem that is an artefact of wishing to isolate one function out of many. Sensitivity analyses as such are, however, not discussed further in this paper.

## 2 Method: Economic Allocation

For all more theoretical discussions on the pros and cons of economic allocation as opposed to other allocation methods and in relation to ISO Guidelines, we here refer to the Handbook on LCA, in particular to Section 3.9 of Part 3. In this paper we will focus on economic allocation only and briefly describe its principles in practical terms, that is in the way it would be applied in practice. For this, two basic prior definitions are important in particular:

* Functional flow: any of the flows of a unit process that constitute its goal, e.g. the **product outflows (including services) of a production process** and **the waste inflows of a waste treatment process**.

* Multi-functional process: **a unit process** yielding more than one functional flow, i.e. **co-production, combined waste processing and recycling**:
- Co-production: a multi-functional process having more than one functional outflow and no functional inflow.
- Combined waste processing: a multi-functional process having no functional outflow and more than one functional inflow.
- Recycling: a multi-functional process having one or more functional outflows and one or more functional inflows (including cases of combined waste processing and co-production simultaneously).

In the economic literature, multi-functional processes are referred to as joint or combined production (e.g. Koutsoyiannis 1980). In this article we will not distinguish between these two any further but deal with both under the heading of multifunctional processes. The Handbook on LCA distinguishes two steps in solving the multi-functionality problem. The first concerns the modelling of the product system studied in the inventory analysis. In this step system boundaries are set and processes are described and process flows quantified. In this step multi-functionality problems can be identified and the model of the product system is drafted. The better and more specific the model, the less multi-functionality problems will remain. For example, if the processes are specified to unit operation levels (e.g. individual machines), multi-functionality problems may be avoided in some specific cases. This is the starting step in the ISO allocation procedure.

The second step concerns solving the remaining multi-functionality problems. For this step, the Handbook on LCA proposes to systematically apply economic allocation, next to other ways of solving the multifunctionality problem as
sensitivity analyses, and next to other ways, based on physico-chemical relations, for waste treatment processes.

The basic principle of economic allocation is that, having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds. Proceeds are based on prices, and the price can be expressed in any currency such as s US dollars or alike and the unit of flow can be quantified in any quantity and unit in which the prices are stated, such as piece, mass (kg), energy (MJ or kWh) or volume (m3), as long as used consistently through one calculation (e.g. US dollars and ￥ shouldn't be used mixed in one sales of a process is thus considered to indicate its share in the
full existence of that process. The economic value created by a process is considered to be the driver of that process.

It is not always easy to determine the proceeds of a process. However, there are the shares in proceeds that need to be known and not the absolute values. This is also a solution to handling fluctuations. Prices may fluctuate considerably, but often the shares remain quite constant, particularly in the longer term. Long term average share is the relevant time horizon here in theory, although these data may often not be available. The uncertainties attached to these fluctuations are deemed important but not further discussed here. At first glance, we expect that the uncertainties of price fluctuations are comparable to uncertainties attached to other allocation methods as e.g. the physical quantities of functional flows of a particular multi-functional process also fluctuate (for instance,
the amounts of milk and wool produced in sheep breeding will fluctuate per year, as will the prices of milk and wool).

For flows with missing or distorted markets, it may also be difficult to determine proceeds and shares. In the Dutch
Handbook on LCA attention has also been paid to such problems, and Table 1 shows in summary which solutions are
proposed for different problems. For more details, we refer here to Guin6e et al. (2002; Part 2b, 147-151).

Examples of how economic allocation works in practice are presented in the next section.

## 3 examples
### 3.1 Co-coproduction

In 1993, Huppes already proposed economic allocation as solution for multi-functionality problems in LCA studies
(Huppes 1993). Fig. 2 shows an adapted version of the example used by Huppes on co-production of caustic soda,
chlorine and hydrogen.

The functional flows are caustic soda (NaOH), chlorine (CI2) and hydrogen (H2). Assuming the quantities, prices and proceeds stated in Table 2, **allocation factors** can be calculated; these are referred to here as α,β, and γ.

Emissions need to be allocated, i.c. HCI (lxl0 -3 kg), but also other non-functional flows, i.c. sodium chloride use
(11.7 kg) need to be allocated to the three functional flows:

This table clearly shows that functional flows are being allocated to and not allocated themselves: ***all non-functional flows are allocated to the functional flows only***. It also shows that the 100% rule counts for economic allocation: for each flow, the quantities of the mono-functional processes together precisely constitute the original quantity of the multi-functional processes for that specific flow. Of final interest is that one should distinguish between the allocation of a multifunctional process and the ratios in which mono-functional
processes participate in each of the separated systems. Fig. 3 illustrates how the multi-functional electrolysis process can be allocated into three different mono-functional processes, each connected to one and the same mono-functional upstream process.

### 3.2 Two cases of open-loop recycling

A co-production process is simple enough to understand the economic allocation procedure. Recycling processes, however, often create more problems, both conceptually and mathematically. Therefore, we now present four recycling examples starting with two nearly identical cases on open-loop recycling examples for aluminium. The examples are fully hypothetical, and thus cannot be copied into any LCA cases. The calculations have been made with **CMLCA**, and the data files can be downloaded from our website (http://www.leidenuniv.nl/cml/ssp/software/cmlca/index.html).

Fig. 4 shows the first hypothetical open-loop example. There are two processes in this system that need a closer look at: the 'use' process and the 'collection & dismantling' process. The 'use' process has two outflows of which only one is a functional flow (i.e. product): the functional unit '5 years engine use'. ***The other outflow 'used engine' has a negative value and is thus a waste flow*** which should be traced down to it waste management process, i.e. 'secondary aluminium production'. The inflow 'engine' is a product, hence this is not a functional flow. The 'collection & dismantling' process provides a turning point for the economic value of the used engine and aluminium scrap flows and thus we have an example of a multi-functional process, in this case **a recycling process**. As the resulting secondary aluminium is used in other products than the original engine, it is a question of open-loop recycling. Thus the process 'collection & dismantling' needs to be partly allocated to the system of the engine (system 1) and partly to the system using the aluminium scrap (system 2). Assuming the quantities, prices and proceeds stated in Table 4, allocation factors can again be calculated.

In this 'collection & dismantling' process, only one emission is at stake: NH3 to air. This emission needs to be allocated to the aluminium scrap (part of system 2) and used engine (part of system 1) as shown in Table 5.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/129483195-6fc90ece-a825-4965-948e-58d69cc7058b.png)

The total emissions follow from Fig. 5. For SO 2 for system 1, the emission thus equals 1×10^(-3) kg and for system 2 equals 0 kg. The total emission of NH3 for system 1 thus equals 1×10^(-3) + 0.8×10^(-3) = 1.8×10^(-3) kg, and for system 2 equals 1.2×10^(-3) + 3×10^(-3) = 4.2×10^(-3) kg.

Now let us look at the second hypothetical open-loop example, which is a slightly different version of the first, see Fig. 6.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/129483254-369811ad-2922-4c72-a627-63d7e9a5d351.png)

Now not only the flow 'used engine' but also the flow 'aluminium scrap' is negatively valued and is thus a waste flow which should be traced down to its waste management process,
i.e. 'secondary aluminium production'. In this case, the
'secondary aluminium production' process provides a turning
point for the economic value of the aluminium scrap and the
secondary aluminium flows and as the latter is used in other
product systems, we have an example of open-loop recycling
again. Now, the process 'secondary aluminium production'
needs to be partly allocated to the aluminium scrap (part of
system 1) and partly to secondary aluminium (part of sys-

[^alloca]: Multi-functionality indicates the problem that product systems under study often provide more functions than the one that is studied in the functional unit of interest. Allocation is one possible solution for this problem. Allocation can be sub-divided into partitioning (according to mass or according to economic proceeds, the latter being the subject of this paper) and substitution (see e.g. Weidema 2001). There are more solutions, however,
such as accepting multi-functionality and modelling it as it is, or the pseudo-inverse (see Heijungs and Frischknecht 1998).
