Overview A growing number of economists and social scientists view the economy as a ‘complex adaptive system’ - a distributed network of dynamically interacting, heterogeneous agents, whose behaviours, strategies and relationships evolve over time. Under such a view the economy is more akin to an ecosystem, the brain, or the internet than to the mechanistic models of traditional theory.</description></item><item><title>Complexity Economics</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_1013/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:05:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_1013/</guid><description>&lt;p>From &lt;strong>The Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School (INET Oxford)&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

Abstract Curbing climate change is gaining increasing consensus globally. While many countries seek to set carbon prices, significant price dispersion and policy stringency continue to raise concerns about competitiveness. To address this issue, the EU has proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which aims to level the playing field by levying a carbon price on EU imports.</description></item><item><title>Carbon Pricing</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0827/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 20:59:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0827/</guid><description>Carbon emissions pricing: Some points of reference https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/649352/EPRS_BRI(2020)649352_EN.pdf

Abstract Sustainability of a bioenergy project depends on precise assessment of biomass resource, planning of cost-effective logistics and evaluation of possible environmental implications. In this context, this paper reviews the role and applications of geo-spatial tool such as Geographical Information System (GIS) for precise agro-residue resource assessment, biomass logistic and power plant design. Further, application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in understanding the potential impact of agro-residue bioenergy generation on different ecosystem services has also been reviewed and limitations associated with LCA variability and uncertainty were discussed.</description></item><item><title>On the competitiveness impact of the EU CBAM: An Input-Output approach</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0821/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 16:37:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0821/</guid><description>Jiarui ZHONG, Martin-Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.

Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a &amp;lsquo;cookbook&amp;rsquo; with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step.</description></item><item><title>Proper or messy allocation?--Systematic approach to identifying and solving multi-functionality in LCA</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 11:20:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</guid><description>Avoided burden1
Most existing LCA databases today do not include multi-functional processes.
including ecoinvent MF is &amp;lsquo;solved&amp;rsquo; by database developers by delivering only mono-functional datasets.
Mostly, practitioners cannot change this methodological decision anymore and often don&amp;rsquo;t realize that they are handling (&amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo;) more MF issues than they realize.
Consequently, most software doesn&amp;rsquo;t include ways to address MF.

Almost every overview of LCA gives a graphical indication of the idea of a life cycle. Such diagrams consist of a linear sequence or network of blocks, connected with arrows, representing the major life stages of a product life cycle. Examples from recent textbooks on LCA can be found in Klöpffer and Grahl (2014, p. 2), Jolliet et al. (2016, p. 36), and Hauschild et al. (2018, p. 120). All such flow diagrams agree on the basic setup of a chronological order: resource becomes products, products are used, and it all ends with disposal of waste.</description></item><item><title>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Vs Photovoltaic (PV): An In-depth Comparison</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0728/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 22:32:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0728/</guid><description>The rise in the popularity of solar power energy comes with the expansion of the technologies associated with it.

Research background Food security is challenged by increasing global food demand driven by population growth and animal-based diets. More crop production requires increasing areas of land and fresh water, causing associated environmental impacts1. Also livestock should be a focus as their feed contains harmful ingredients2 which will released to our environment finally.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the spatially explicit global footprints of European net-zero strategies</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0602/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 10:11:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0602/</guid><description>“Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” &amp;mdash;Warren Buffett.
Research aim Building a detailed, spatially explicit, internationally trade linked GMRIO of food and energy systems at a ~5arc min(9km) resolution. Exploring current environmental and social footprints of these systems and the threats or opportunities presented by EU net-zero strategies. Incorporating net-zero pathways from the literature into the model from both production and consumption perspectives, and connecting land suitability maps for future renewable energy, mining, and agriculture potentials.</description></item><item><title>Impacts of COVID-19 and fiscal stimuli on global emissions and the Paris Agreement</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0528/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 11:06:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0528/</guid><description>Published:22 December 2020

Scenarios of global lockdown and effects on CO2 emissions Economic impacts model ARIO model：Adaptive Regional Input-Output Model can be used to analyse the disaster-induced influence on regional economy.
The Leontief production function does not allow for substitution between inputs.
Scenarios of lockdown Lockdown periods Strictness of the first lockdown period Strictness of future lockdown periods Labour loss dominates the economic loss in the model.</description></item><item><title>RP Project</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0526/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 10:10:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0526/</guid><description>Measuring in Arc-Seconds The source link
USGS: United States Geological Survey. DEM: Digital elevation model [Wiki search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model#:~:text=A%20digital%20elevation%20model%20(DEM,to%20a%20discrete%20global%20grid) Some USGS DEM data is stored in a format that utilizes three, five, or 30 arc-seconds of longitude and latitude to register cell values. The geographic reference system treats the globe as if it were a sphere divided into 360 equal parts called degrees.
Said differently, an arc-second represents the distance of latitude or longitude across the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface with the angle of one second.</description></item><item><title>Global Scenarios of Resource and Emissions Savings from systemic Material Efficiency in Buildings and Cars</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0521/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 11:12:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0521/</guid><description>Abstract Here we present a high-resolution approach for tracking material flows and energy use of products throughout their life cycles, focusing on passenger vehicles and residential buildings. We estimate future changes in material flows and operational energy use due to increased yields, light-weight designs, material substitution, increased service efficiency, extended service life, and increased reuse and recycling.
Main Text comprised of 20 countries/regions six major climate-relevant materials (aluminium, cement, copper, plastics, steel, wood) for the period 2016 - 2060.</description></item><item><title>Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0517/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0517/</guid><description>Identify climate change problems where existing gaps can be filled by machine learning.

Highlights Industry ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under the following circumstances.
when there is enough accessible, high-quality data around specific processes or transport routes. when firms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with researchers and other firms. When aspects of production or shipping can be readily fine-tuned or adjusted, and there are clear objective functions.</description></item></channel></rss>
