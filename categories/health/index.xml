What are love handles? &amp;ldquo;Love handles&amp;rdquo; are areas of skin that extend outward from the hips. When combined with tight clothing, love handles become more pronounced, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t caused by tight clothing alone. They indicate excess fat accumulation around the hips and abdominal area.
What causes love handles?

Generally speaking, fat cells accumulate when your body takes in too many calories or you don&amp;rsquo;t burn as many calories as you&amp;rsquo;re consuming.</description></item><item><title>Covid 19 Self Testing</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/de_0518/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 22:07:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/de_0518/</guid><description>Interesting warnings British humour?
