Economic Allocation: Examples and Derived Decision Tree Jeroen B. Guinde*, Reinout Heijungs and Gjah Huppes Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University, P.O. Box 9518, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Int J LCA 9 (1) 23 - 33 (2004)
Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a &amp;lsquo;cookbook&amp;rsquo; with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step.</description></item><item><title>Waste is not a service</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0808/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 11:03:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0808/</guid><description>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11367-021-01955-5.pdf
Almost every overview of LCA gives a graphical indication of the idea of a life cycle. Such diagrams consist of a linear sequence or network of blocks, connected with arrows, representing the major life stages of a product life cycle. Examples from recent textbooks on LCA can be found in Klöpffer and Grahl (2014, p. 2), Jolliet et al. (2016, p. 36), and Hauschild et al. (2018, p. 120). All such flow diagrams agree on the basic setup of a chronological order: resource becomes products, products are used, and it all ends with disposal of waste.</description></item><item><title>Spatially-explicit footprints of agricultural commodities Mapping carbon emissions embodied in Brazil's soy exports</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0706/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:08:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0706/</guid><description>Abstract LCA faces limitations when it comes to addressing spatial and temporal variability in production, transportation and manufacturing systems. By the integration of LCA principles with enhanced physical trade flow analysis. Estimating the carbon footprint1 of Brazilian soy exports over the period 2010–2015 based on over 90000 individual traded flows of beans, oil and protein cake from the municipality of origin through international markets. A large spatial variability in co2 across sourcing areas, importers and sub-stages has been detected.</description></item></channel></rss>
