Abstract Sustainability of a bioenergy project depends on precise assessment of biomass resource, planning of cost-effective logistics and evaluation of possible environmental implications. In this context, this paper reviews the role and applications of geo-spatial tool such as Geographical Information System (GIS) for precise agro-residue resource assessment, biomass logistic and power plant design. Further, application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in understanding the potential impact of agro-residue bioenergy generation on different ecosystem services has also been reviewed and limitations associated with LCA variability and uncertainty were discussed.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Course on LCA —— Session 3: Economic Allocation</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0816/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:13:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0816/</guid><description>Session 3 Purpose This software session focuses on reproducing the results of an LCA paper on economic allocation, defining functional flows and identifying multi functional processes, with the software program CMLCA. In today’s exercises, you will learn:
to understand the main principles of economic allocation; how such analyses work in CMLCA software. You may perform the exercise alone or together with (a) colleague(s) in a virtual room, and again, you don’t have to hand in the results.</description></item><item><title>Economic Allocation: Examples and Derived Decision Tree</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0815/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 09:24:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0815/</guid><description>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02978533.pdf

Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a &amp;lsquo;cookbook&amp;rsquo; with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step.</description></item><item><title>Proper or messy allocation?--Systematic approach to identifying and solving multi-functionality in LCA</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 11:20:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</guid><description>Avoided burden1
Most existing LCA databases today do not include multi-functional processes.
including ecoinvent MF is &amp;lsquo;solved&amp;rsquo; by database developers by delivering only mono-functional datasets.
Mostly, practitioners cannot change this methodological decision anymore and often don&amp;rsquo;t realize that they are handling (&amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo;) more MF issues than they realize.
Consequently, most software doesn&amp;rsquo;t include ways to address MF.
While it is known as one of the most determining factors of LCA results.</description></item><item><title>Land use indicators in LCA</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0810/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 09:54:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0810/</guid><description>Principles for life cycle inventories of land use on a global scale Thomas Koellner, Laura de Baan, Tabea Beck, Miguel Brandão, Barbara Civit, Mark Goedkoop, Manuele Margni, Llorenç Milà i Canals, Ruedi Müller-Wenk, Bo Weidema &amp;amp; Bastian Wittstock

Almost every overview of LCA gives a graphical indication of the idea of a life cycle. Such diagrams consist of a linear sequence or network of blocks, connected with arrows, representing the major life stages of a product life cycle. Examples from recent textbooks on LCA can be found in Klöpffer and Grahl (2014, p. 2), Jolliet et al. (2016, p. 36), and Hauschild et al. (2018, p. 120). All such flow diagrams agree on the basic setup of a chronological order: resource becomes products, products are used, and it all ends with disposal of waste.</description></item><item><title>Spatially-explicit footprints of agricultural commodities Mapping carbon emissions embodied in Brazil's soy exports</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0706/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:08:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0706/</guid><description>Abstract LCA faces limitations when it comes to addressing spatial and temporal variability in production, transportation and manufacturing systems.

A large spatial variability in co2 across sourcing areas, importers and sub-stages has been detected.</description></item></channel></rss>
