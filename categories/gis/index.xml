Nature-based solutions and scenarios Nature-based Solutions (BbS) are actions that enable the protection, sustainable management and restoration of natural and managed ecosystems, that can simultaneously provide human well-being an biodiversity benefits.
Nature-based solutions (NbS) include restoration, management, and rehabilitation measures, as well as conservation of ecosystems, that enhance nature’s contribution to people, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, assisted natural regeneration and urban green and blue spaces.</description></item><item><title>Mapping global patterns of land use decision-making</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0630/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:01:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0630/</guid><description>ŽigaMalekaPeter H.Verburgab Department of Environmental Geography, Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1087, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands Available online 23 September 2020.
How such local-scale patterns of decision-making can be used to explain land-use change globally is unknown. Using a collection of local studies from a literature review, we studied the contextual conditions of different modes of land-use change decision-making and present global maps of the potential distribution of decision-making in land-use change.</description></item></channel></rss>
