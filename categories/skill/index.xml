Never go higher than ISO 1600 or the image gets noisy. Keep you shutter speed between1/30s and 1/50s (lights start flickering with higher speed). Aperture should be F/1.2 to F/5.6.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.
thistuple = (&amp;#34;apple&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;banana&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34;) Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values. When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change. Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.</description></item><item><title>Creating multiple subplots using plt.subplots</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_0830/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 11:31:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_0830/</guid><description>pyplot.subplots creates a figure and a grid of subplots with a single call, while providing reasonable control over how the individual plots are created. For more advanced use cases you can use GridSpec for a more general subplot layout or Figure.add_subplot for adding subplots at arbitrary locations within the figure.

matplotlib.pyplot.subplots
matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, *, sharex=False, sharey=False, squeeze=True, subplot_kw=None, gridspec_kw=None, **fig_kw)

Why Europe is so critical in British supply chains The EU is the UK&amp;rsquo;s largest trading partner, accounting for approximately half of both imports and exports of goods (Exhibit1). Moreover, a large proportion of the UK’s imports from and exports to the EU are in the form of intermediary products—an indicator of the high degree of interconnectedness between UK and EU supply chains (Exhibit 2).</description></item><item><title>PhD transferable skills</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_0525/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 09:09:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_0525/</guid><description>Here are examples of PhD skill sets and ways to describe them by University of Michigan.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for PhD students to identify what skills they have since the academic experience is not necessarily focused on articulating skill sets. We also often find that PhD students struggle, understandably, to present the transferability of their academic experiences to non-academic contexts.

Your supervisor Before you begin your dissertation, it is highly likely you will be assigned a supervisor to oversee your progress from first steps to completion. Your supervisor will help you formulate ideas and give you guidance on how best to develop your research topic and course of action. But you need to always remember that this is your project, and your supervisor will not provide you with content or additional lessons on a particular topic.</description></item><item><title>Changing Fonts in hugo website</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_05172/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill/skill_05172/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to Damien.
