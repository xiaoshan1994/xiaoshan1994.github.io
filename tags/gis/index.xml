Abstract Sustainability of a bioenergy project depends on precise assessment of biomass resource, planning of cost-effective logistics and evaluation of possible environmental implications. In this context, this paper reviews the role and applications of geo-spatial tool such as Geographical Information System (GIS) for precise agro-residue resource assessment, biomass logistic and power plant design. Further, application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in understanding the potential impact of agro-residue bioenergy generation on different ecosystem services has also been reviewed and limitations associated with LCA variability and uncertainty were discussed.</description></item><item><title>Mapping global patterns of land use decision-making</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re/re_0630/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:01:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re/re_0630/</guid><description>Å½igaMalekaPeter H.Verburgab

How such local-scale patterns of decision-making can be used to explain land-use change globally is unknown. Using a collection of local studies from a literature review, we studied the contextual conditions of different modes of land-use change decision-making and present global maps of the potential distribution of decision-making in land-use change.</description></item></channel></rss>
