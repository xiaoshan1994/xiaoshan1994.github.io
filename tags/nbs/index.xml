Nature-based solutions and scenarios Nature-based Solutions (BbS) are actions that enable the protection, sustainable management and restoration of natural and managed ecosystems, that can simultaneously provide human well-being an biodiversity benefits.
Nature-based solutions (NbS) include restoration, management, and rehabilitation measures, as well as conservation of ecosystems, that enhance natureâ€™s contribution to people, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, assisted natural regeneration and urban green and blue spaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
