We estimate future changes in material flows and operational energy use due to increased yields, light-weight designs, material substitution, increased service efficiency, extended service life, and increased reuse and recycling.
Main Text comprised of 20 countries/regions six major climate-relevant materials (aluminium, cement, copper, plastics, steel, wood) for the period 2016 - 2060.</description></item></channel></rss>
