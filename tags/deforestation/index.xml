By the integration of LCA principles with enhanced physical trade flow analysis. Estimating the carbon footprint1 of Brazilian soy exports over the period 2010â€“2015 based on over 90000 individual traded flows of beans, oil and protein cake from the municipality of origin through international markets. A large spatial variability in co2 across sourcing areas, importers and sub-stages has been detected.</description></item></channel></rss>
