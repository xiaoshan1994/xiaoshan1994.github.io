Europe needs to account for the emissions of imported goods. That cannot happen without the international agreement on standards and certification systems for the carbon intensity of all steps in the value chain for all relevant products. Dolf Gielen and Francisco Boshell at IRENA and Massamba Thioye at the UNFCCC explain that several such systems exist around the world, but they need to be harmonised and widely adopted to truly reflect what is happening.</description></item><item><title>CBAM needs universal adoption of methods for measuring carbon intensity</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_1012/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 10:55:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_1012/</guid><description>August 31, 2021 by Dolf Gielen, Massamba Thioye and Francisco Boshell Leave a Comment.

Abstract Curbing climate change is gaining increasing consensus globally. While many countries seek to set carbon prices, significant price dispersion and policy stringency continue to raise concerns about competitiveness. To address this issue, the EU has proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which aims to level the playing field by levying a carbon price on EU imports.</description></item><item><title>On the competitiveness impact of the EU CBAM: An Input-Output approach</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0826/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 10:52:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0826/</guid><description>Abstract While many countries seek to set a price for carbon emissions,
significant price dispersion and relative stringency keep raising concerns on carbon leakage.
We quantify the competitiveness impact of the EU CBAM based on the multi-regional Input-Output approach.</description></item><item><title>On the competitiveness impact of the EU CBAM: An Input-Output approach</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0821/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 16:37:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0821/</guid><description>Jiarui ZHONG, Martin-Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.
