Generally, OECD members are high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index (HDI) and are regarded as developed countries.
This guide presents the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) indicators published by OECD. The latest indicators were estimated based on the 2018 release of OECD’s annual Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables which cover the period 2005 to 2015.</description></item></channel></rss>
