Research aim Building a detailed, spatially explicit, internationally trade linked GMRIO of food and energy systems at a ~5arc min(9km) resolution. Exploring current environmental and social footprints of these systems and the threats or opportunities presented by EU net-zero strategies. Incorporating net-zero pathways from the literature into the model from both production and consumption perspectives, and connecting land suitability maps for future renewable energy, mining, and agriculture potentials.</description></item></channel></rss>
