1. Introduction 1.1. Developments in Multi-Regional Input-Output Analysis (MRIO) Harmonization Compared to other databases, EXIOBASE has a clear environmental and resource focus with high levels of detail in primary production.
Harmonizing and detailing supply and use tables (SUT):
Gathering SUT from the relevant statistical offices. In the specific case of EXIOBASE, data is gathered from the EU27 via Eurostat, and other SUT and IO tables from 16 other countries.</description></item><item><title>From Satellite to Supply Chain: New Approaches Connect Earth Observation to Economic Decisions</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_rp_0710/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 10:10:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_rp_0710/</guid><description>why we need more transparent supply chains? A growing share of countries’ environmental and social impacts occurs abroad; Businesses and shareholders need to identify and evaluate the potential environmental impacts and biodiversity loss of their foreign producers; Individual consumers increasingly ask for the locations and magnitude of the impacts associated with their choices; Contributing to an accountability framework that would trigger higher environmental standards in the specific industry of producing countries.</description></item><item><title>Manual of EXIOBASE V3.8 updates</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0609/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 09:33:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0609/</guid><description>v3.8 was released in November 2020, provided with a full re-estimate of the time-series (to 2021) that heavily relies on &amp;ldquo;now-casting&amp;rdquo; economic structure (and environmental extensions).
The time-series extends into the future (2021), but this is based on the now-casting procedure and projections of GDP and aggregate trade of the IMF.
Main updates Macroeconomic and trade data for recent years
Updated to 2018 macroeconomic data from UN, and GDP &amp;amp; gross import/export projections until 2022 from IMF.</description></item><item><title>Linking Global Crop and Livestock Consumption to Local Production Hotspots</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0606/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 09:42:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0606/</guid><description>Identifying production hotspots for global crop and livestock consumption by a Spatially Explicit Multi-Reginal Input-Output model ( Zhongxiao&amp;rsquo;s work on Global Food Security).
Keywords: primary crops; animal husbandry; spatially explicit; Multi-Regional Input-Output(MRIO) analysis.
Research background Food security is challenged by increasing global food demand driven by population growth and animal-based diets. More crop production requires increasing areas of land and fresh water, causing associated environmental impacts1. Also livestock should be a focus as their feed contains harmful ingredients2 which will released to our environment finally.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the spatially explicit global footprints of European net-zero strategies</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_rp_0602/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 10:11:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_rp_0602/</guid><description>“Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” &amp;mdash;Warren Buffett.
Research aim Building a detailed, spatially explicit, internationally trade linked GMRIO of food and energy systems at a ~5arc min(9km) resolution. Exploring current environmental and social footprints of these systems and the threats or opportunities presented by EU net-zero strategies. Incorporating net-zero pathways from the literature into the model from both production and consumption perspectives, and connecting land suitability maps for future renewable energy, mining, and agriculture potentials.</description></item></channel></rss>
