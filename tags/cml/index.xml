Abstract Here, we present the LC-IMPACT method that provides characterization factors at the damage level for 11 impact categories related to three areas of protection (human health, ecosystem quality, natural resources).</description></item><item><title>Advanced Course on LCA —— Session 3: Economic Allocation</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0816/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:13:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0816/</guid><description>Session 3 Purpose This software session focuses on reproducing the results of an LCA paper on economic allocation, defining functional flows and identifying multi functional processes, with the software program CMLCA. In today’s exercises, you will learn:
to understand the main principles of economic allocation; how such analyses work in CMLCA software. You may perform the exercise alone or together with (a) colleague(s) in a virtual room, and again, you don’t have to hand in the results.</description></item><item><title>Economic Allocation: Examples and Derived Decision Tree</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0815/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 09:24:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0815/</guid><description>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02978533.pdf
Economic Allocation: Examples and Derived Decision Tree Jeroen B. Guinde*, Reinout Heijungs and Gjah Huppes Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University, P.O. Box 9518, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Int J LCA 9 (1) 23 - 33 (2004)
Abstract Goal, Scope and Background. In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a &amp;lsquo;cookbook&amp;rsquo; with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step.</description></item><item><title>Proper or messy allocation?--Systematic approach to identifying and solving multi-functionality in LCA</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 11:20:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0814/</guid><description>Avoided burden1 Most existing LCA databases today do not include multi-functional processes.
including ecoinvent MF is &amp;lsquo;solved&amp;rsquo; by database developers by delivering only mono-functional datasets.
Mostly, practitioners cannot change this methodological decision anymore and often don&amp;rsquo;t realize that they are handling (&amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo;) more MF issues than they realize.
Consequently, most software doesn&amp;rsquo;t include ways to address MF.
While it is known as one of the most determining factors of LCA results.</description></item><item><title>Waste is not a service</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0808/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 11:03:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/re_0808/</guid><description>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11367-021-01955-5.pdf
Almost every overview of LCA gives a graphical indication of the idea of a life cycle. Such diagrams consist of a linear sequence or network of blocks, connected with arrows, representing the major life stages of a product life cycle. Examples from recent textbooks on LCA can be found in Klöpffer and Grahl (2014, p. 2), Jolliet et al. (2016, p. 36), and Hauschild et al. (2018, p. 120). All such flow diagrams agree on the basic setup of a chronological order: resource becomes products, products are used, and it all ends with disposal of waste.</description></item><item><title>MSc Industrial Ecology programme</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_0618/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 10:37:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_0618/</guid><description>Industrial Ecology The MSc Industrial Ecology (joint degree Leiden University and TU Delft) is an interdisciplinary and international programme, which focuses on the analysis of sustainability problems and the design and implementation of solutions for these problems; all from a socio-technical system perspective. The aim of the programme is to educate students to become researchers or practitioners who can contribute to the development of solutions for persistent sustainability problems, such as related to resource depletion and climate change.</description></item><item><title>GIA in the EIOA class: exploring the impact of Brexit (2)</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_06072/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 15:35:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_06072/</guid><description>The Brexit topic from the BBC News.

Why Europe is so critical in British supply chains The EU is the UK&amp;rsquo;s largest trading partner, accounting for approximately half of both imports and exports of goods (Exhibit1). Moreover, a large proportion of the UK’s imports from and exports to the EU are in the form of intermediary products—an indicator of the high degree of interconnectedness between UK and EU supply chains (Exhibit 2).</description></item><item><title>EIOA Class: Integrated Group Assignment(IGA)</title><link>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_05173/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xiaoshan1994.github.io/post/skill_05173/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each group is expected to perform a research question about two real-world issues: BREXIT and national stimulus plans.
