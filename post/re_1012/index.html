<p>Europe needs to account for the emissions of imported goods. That cannot happen without the <strong>international agreement on standards and certification systems</strong> for the carbon intensity of all steps in the value chain for all relevant products. Dolf Gielen and Francisco Boshell at IRENA and Massamba Thioye at the UNFCCC explain that several such systems exist around the world, but they need to be harmonised and widely adopted to truly reflect what is happening. It is a matter of urgency, as growing international trade must go hand in hand with the deep decarbonisation of energy intensive industries (think iron, steel, aluminium, chemicals and petrochemicals, building materials including cement, lime, glass, bricks, tiles). Following the European Commission’s proposal for a <strong>Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)</strong>, the authors summarise the issues and make their recommendations. They cover existing mechanisms like Renewable Energy Certificates, Power Purchase Agreements, GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Clean Development Mechanism as well as new accounting systems for green gases, and the role digitalisation can play.</p>
<h3 id=the-cbam-rationale-according-to-the-european-commission>The CBAM rationale according to the European Commission</h3>
<p>The European Union (EU) has established <strong>a target of 55% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030</strong> and <strong>net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</strong>. Today’s emissions are dominated by energy related CO2.</p>
<p>Figure 1: European GHG emissions, 2018. Notes: Energy industries: Emissions from fuel combustion and to a certain extent fugitive emissions from energy industries, for example in public electricity, heat production and petroleum refining. Fuel combustion by users (excl. transport): Emissions from fuel combustion by manufacturing industries and construction and small scale fuel combustion, for example, space heating and hot water production for households, commercial buildings, agriculture and forestry. Transport: Emissions from fuel combustion of domestic and international aviation, road transport, railways and domestic navigation. Agriculture: This includes among others, emissions from livestock-centric fermentation – greenhouse gases that are produced when animals digest their food, emissions from manure management and emissions from agricultural soils. Industrial processes: Emissions occurring from chemical reactions during the production of e.g.: cement, glass etc. Data including international aviation, excluding indirect CO2 emissions and land use, land use change and forestry. / Source: Based on EUROSTAT <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_air_gge&lang=en">http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_air_gge&lang=en</a></p>
<p>The effort required going forward is much more important than the previous target of a <strong>20% reduction in 2020</strong>, compared to <strong>1990 levels</strong> (an objective that was already reached in 2018). It implies a much-accelerated emissions reduction in the coming decades.</p>
<p>Such emissions reduction can only be achieved if all sectors are considered.</p>
<h3 id=energy-intensive-industries>Energy intensive industries</h3>
<p>This includes energy intensive industries. These industries are a source of direct emissions, but they also consume significant amounts of electricity and heat, and they are a source of process emissions (Figure 1). Part of those industries are <strong>iron and steel making, aluminium making, the chemical and petrochemical industry, and ceramic materials production including cement, lime, glass, bricks and tiles</strong>.</p>
<p>The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) CO2 price is currently around <strong>50 Euros per tonne of CO2</strong>. Having to buy such emission permits can significantly increase the production cost for some sectors. <em><strong>If importers in these sectors do not face the same carbon cost, this can distort competition, reduce competitiveness and increase imports</strong></em>. <em><strong>As a result, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase elsewhere, so-called carbon leakage, wiping out the GHG mitigation effort in Europe</strong></em>.</p>
<p>To manage that risk of carbon leakage, exposed industries have been so far <em><strong>granted free allowances and compensations</strong></em> for the increase in electricity costs under state aid rules as part of the EU ETS. However, free allocation under the EU scheme weakens the price signal that the system provides for the installations receiving it compared to full auctioning.</p>
<h3 id=phasing-out-free-allocations>Phasing out free allocations</h3>
<p>The European Commission has presented a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) <em><strong>as a means to progressively remove the free allocation while addressing the risk of carbon leakage</strong></em>. Indeed, the impact assessment of the proposal concluded that <strong>a 10-year phasing in period starting in 2026</strong>, during which the free allocations of allowances under the EU ETS would be gradually phased out by <strong>10 percentage points each year</strong> and the CBAM would be phased in, provides clear benefits relative to all other options considered in the proposal.</p>
<p>This policy option ensures a high level of effectiveness for the CBAM and it is expected to add compatibility with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Indeed, free allocation to industry has been identified by some experts as a possible issue for the compatibility of the scheme with WTO. The use of the revenues from the levy has also been identified by some experts as another issue of compatibility with WTO. <em><strong>An UNCTAD report published on 14 July concluded: The CBAM could help avoid “carbon leakage”, but its impact on climate change would be limited – only a 0.1% drop in global CO2 emissions – with higher trade costs for developing countries.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id=the-cbam-carbon-accounting-concept>The CBAM carbon accounting concept</h3>
<p>The European Commission has published a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council establishing a carbon border adjustment mechanism. According to that proposal, <em><strong>CBAM will initially be applied for cement, electricity, fertilisers, iron and steel, and aluminium and will require importers to buy CBAM certificates that are priced at the same level as ETS certificates</strong></em>. The number of certificates that need to be bought will depend on the <strong>volume</strong> and the <strong>carbon intensity</strong> of the imports. Hence, the need for <strong>a calculation method for carbon intensity of products</strong>.</p>
<p>For a company operating in a specific value-chain, its GHG emissions can be split into <strong>scope 1</strong> (<strong>direct emissions from the production processes it owns or controls</strong>), <strong>scope 2</strong> (<strong>indirect emissions related to electricity and heat provision</strong>) and <strong>scope 3</strong> emissions (<strong>all indirect emissions not included in scope 2 that occur in the value chain of the company, including both upstream and downstream emissions</strong>).</p>
<p>CBAM specifies that for electricity imported in the EU, default values shall be determined based on either specific default values for a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country, or <em><strong>if those values are not available, on EU default values for similar electricity production in the EU</strong></em>. Where no specific default value has been determined for a third country, a group of third countries, or a region within a third country, the default value to be used for the determination of embodied CO2 in imported electricity is the EU CO2 emission factor, which is <strong>the EU average CO2 intensity of electricity produced with fossil fuels</strong>.</p>
<p>The alternative is to opt for actual emissions for the electricity exported to the EU. If a declarant has a <strong>power purchase agreement (PPA)</strong> with an electricity producer in a third country, the emission intensity of the delivered electricity can be applied. That CO2 intensity can be applied for the amount generated through the PPA, but for any additional electricity exported to the EU by the declarant, the default applies.</p>
<p>Recycling is not specifically mentioned. The energy and CO2 intensity of recycled aluminium and steel is much lower than for primary material produced from natural resources. Producers in Europe and abroad may opt to use more scrap feedstock to meet the requirements. This represents a potential loophole if only Europe applies such carbon accounting practices for energy-intensive materials and scrap can be imported for recycling, which would reduce the CO2 emissions embedded in Europe’s consumption but increase the carbon footprint of products consumed elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id=renewable-energy-certificates-rec>Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)</h3>
<p>Various standards have been developed to establish the renewable electricity content in supply. As renewable electricity has generally no direct CO2 emissions, the use of renewable electricity is a proxy for the use of CO2-free electricity.</p>
<p>In Europe, <strong>Guarantees of Origin (GO)</strong> are deployed for renewable electricity tracking and the standard CENELEC 16325 has been developed for GO tracking. Revision of CENELEC 16325 is currently ongoing with the intent to broaden the scope from electricity to gas including hydrogen as well as heating and cooling supply. Also, an international REC standard exists.</p>
<p>Market volumes are significant:<br>
In Europe, GO totalled 700 TWh <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> in 2019<br>
In the US, Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) totalled 430 TWh in 2019, including renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and voluntary certificates<br>
Also, a global REC system has been developed that is deployed elsewhere (18 TWh in 2019)<br>
These numbers can be compared with a total global electricity production on the order of 25,000 TWh per year, so around 5% of all electricity is counted as renewables through these systems.</p>
<h3 id=power-purchase-agreements>Power Purchase Agreements</h3>
<p>Apart from these accounting systems there are power purchase agreements (PPAs). 23.7 GW of corporate renewable PPAs were concluded in 2020, equal to nearly 9% of total renewable power capacity additions the same year. PPAs have grown significantly in the last three years. Amazon was the most active company, signing 35 PPAs totalling 5.5 GW of capacity. Semiconductor manufacturer TSMC, Total Energies, US telecoms company Verizon, and Facebook rounded out the top five in PPA volume terms.</p>
<p>PPA contracts can be used to prove the renewable nature of supply. However, discussions regarding the diversion of supply remain, even for new installations. For example, server centres in the Netherlands signed PPAs for new wind energy sources that would have otherwise fed into the grid. Similar scarcity issues exist related to hydropower in many places. Also, in situations where grids constitute a bottleneck, this may be a problem. CBAM specifically accounts for this issue.</p>
