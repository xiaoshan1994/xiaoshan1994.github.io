Introduction LCA-PR</h1><p><strong>Overall aim</strong>: provide sufficient scientific basis and practical skills to perform an attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) study.</p><p>• Draft a concise, to-the-point proposal for their own LCA research including a brief<br>literature review<br>• Perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA study<br>• Develop a proper LCA model in CMLCA<br>• Present results, identify problems and propose solutions<br>• Plan and monitor research<br>• Report an LCA study and its findings transparently and comprehensively<br>• Identify, justify and report LCA&rsquo;s key methodological assumptions and choices<br>• Critically evaluate and discuss the possibilities and constraints of their LCA study.</p><p><strong>Assignment 1: Research proposal</strong></p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the <span class="highlight-text blue">environmental relevance</span> of the chosen case study with existing literature as well as provide <span class="highlight-text blue">justification</span> for the use of LCA in their specific applications. The goal of the research proposal is for students to formulate the research question (including a hot spot analysis), identify challenges and make a work plan.</p><h2 id=research-proposal-requirements-and-guidelines>Research proposal requirements and guidelines</h2><p>As preparation for drafting the research proposal, students are required to read the article by Hengl and Gould (2002): <a href=https://www.itc.nl/library/papers/hengl_rules.pdf>https://www.itc.nl/library/papers/hengl_rules.pdf</a>. Proposals are graded according to how well the student follows the requirements below.</p><h2 id=format-and-submission-requirements>Format and submission requirements:</h2><p>• Proposals must be submitted through Brightspace (Leiden) / Assignments (use the similarity check to resolve any outstanding issues prior to the due date).<br>• Max. 2000 words including a maximum 300 words abstract, Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices.</p><h2 id=content-requirements>Content requirements:</h2><p>• <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>student name</strong><br>• <strong>Abstract</strong> (300 words): Define the research question(s), propose an LCA case study, describe the scope and discuss your approach. Tell us why the case study is important and why a life cycle approach is necessary. The abstract at this point should make your audience want to know more about your study without necessarily having the final results.<br>• <strong>Introduction</strong> (problem statement, literature review, research question, …. ): Include background information, previous research on the topic (including LCA literature). Here, you will use existing literature (at least 2 reference LCA studies) to construct the problem statement and identify a knowledge gap. For example, “all studies so far focus on the comparative advantages at the use phase, while neglecting manufacturing and processing which may not compensate for gains in efficiency. This study takes a life cycle approach to evaluate the systemic environmental implications of A and B and determine if there is an environmental advantage to either one. Moreover, hot spots are identified for both alternatives”.<br>• <strong>Goal and Scope Definition</strong>: Under goal definition include a brief discussion on goal, intended application of your study, researcher, commissioner, target audience, steeringcie, expert reviewer. Under scope definition include a brief discussion on ALCA/CLCA, detailed LCA, temporal/geographical/technology coverage, coverage of processes and of interventions and impacts. Finally, discuss function, FU, alternatives, and reference flows.<br>• <strong>Flowcharts</strong>: Preliminary flowcharts following the conventions learned during the Theory week (no copy from literature). One flow chart per alternative.<br>• <strong>Method</strong>: This section outlines how you will proceed with your LCA. This includes data collection (identified data sources), impact assessment families applied, recycling, and allocation.<br>• <strong>Fulfillment of model requirements</strong> (pg. 8). Discuss how you will meet the model requirements (see below under assignment 3).<br>• <strong>Discussion</strong>: Identify possible difficulties and their solutions. This is an opportunity to identify areas that may be challenging. Along with the challenges, try to propose a solution (even if it is too early) as you can get feedback on how you plan to proceed.<br>• <strong>Planning</strong>: Provide a schedule for the work plan. This should include all phases of LCA as presented during the Theory Week as well as the milestones (assignments) and possible periods that you will not be able to work on your case study.<br>• <strong>References</strong>: Use the format of the Journal of Industrial Ecology (Harvard style) to organize your references (<a href=https://jie.yale.edu/jie-style-guide-accepted-manuscripts>https://jie.yale.edu/jie-style-guide-accepted-manuscripts</a>) and/or use a reference manager using the correct (JIE) export settings or Word import settings. Include relevant and sufficient</p><h2 id=advice>Advice</h2><p>Use the theory week to think, talk and discuss your ideas with the group;<br>Use the terminology you learned during the theory week (glossary);<br>Time is limited, focus on the course requirements and don’t set your additional requirements too high. For example, leave the “Life Cycle Stage contribution analysis” for the end.<br>While waiting for our feedback you can already start doing your research, use all the time you have.</p><h2 id=assignment-2-presentation><strong>Assignment 2: Presentation</strong></h2><h2 id=assignment-3-final-report><strong>Assignment 3: Final report</strong></h2><p>For the LCA-PR course the student is expected to perform a methodologically consistent and proper LCA case study based on what has been taught during the Theory Week. The student needs to submit a properly structured and type-written report, along with the CMLCA-file (‘model’) that is created for the LCA study. Through the report and the CMLCA-file, the student should convince the course instructors that (s)he understands the LCA theory, how to apply the theory in practice in a case study, and how to interpret an LCA study’s results taking into account the proper use and constraints of LCA.</p><p>The results of the case study performed during the course cannot generally classify as a full LCA. Instead, this is more of an educational exercise. Please have this in mind when performing your case study.</p><h2 id=model-requirements-mandatory><strong>Model requirements (Mandatory!):</strong></h2><p>In addition to the use of the background ecoinvent v3.4 database, the student should model (in CMLCA) at least 5 foreground unit processes including:</p><p>• 1 disposal process (modelling waste flows out and not waste services (as goods) in!)<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup><br>• 1 closed-loop (reuse or closed-loop recycling);<br>• 1 multifunctional co-production process (not open-loop recycling, but co-production process!) (explicitly reporting on all 4 steps as learned during the Theory Week; see last slide of the Allocation presentation); applying two ways (of which one may be a sensitivity analysis) of allocation including economic allocation<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>;<br>• 1 unit process with at least 3 environmental emissions (extensions) calculated by the student<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. Note that directly gathering values from literature does not count;<br>• at least (!) 1 additional unit process free of choice.</p><p>The closed loop process also needs allocation but this does NOT count as the multifunctional process at the same time, so you need to model these two processes separately.</p><p>Next to the modeling the work should also include a comparison of (at least) two product alternatives, a full impact assessment (not just a couple of impact categories) selecting two families (at least the PEF as baseline, and the CML or ReCiPe family as sensitivity analysis), at least two types of contribution analysis (applying the built-in functions of CMLCA, e.g., at the level of process contributions to category indicator results and at the level of process-emissions contributing to category indicator results for all impact categories, optionally grouping processes manually into stages (which is not the same as a contribution analysis by life cycle stage (LCS or ‘big ship’ analysis), etc.; applying the LCS (or ‘big ship’) contribution analysis is optional, not (!!) mandatory but can deliver extra points when properly performed) and several sensitivity analyses (at least three: one on allocation (see above), one on characterization families (see above); and one free choice, preferably based and justified by your contribution analysis results). Finally, the student should report in a short table how these model requirements have been dealt with in the report.</p><h2 id=reporting>Reporting</h2><p>Students should use the mandatory report lay-out presented below. Next to that the ISO 14040 guidelines should be followed to report the LCA work done. Additional guidance on reporting can be found in the Handbook on LCA, which includes elaborated reporting guidelines on the basis of these ISO reporting guidelines. It is strongly recommended to use the Handbook for this. The abstract should not exceed 300 words. The main report should not exceed 6000 words (no range; 6000 is the limit), including Tables, Figures, frontpages, etc., while excluding only references and appendices. but excluding references and supporting information. Any text beyond 6000 words will not be taken into account for grading, although appendix/appendices may be provided in which the student provides supporting information (no page limit). Don’t forget to insert page numbers in your report! Data reporting is crucial! Students should use the CMLCA unit process data format to present the data for their foreground processes, and in the main report and appendices (supporting information) they should clearly document how they got from the raw literature/internet data to the eventual unit process data implemented in their CMLCA file, including all assumptions, calculations and sources used.</p><p>Finally, you need to carefully think what to put in the main report with the word limit, and what to put in Appendices. You cannot &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; important information to the annexes. All important information needs to be in the main text, and appendices should be made for the inventory table, classification tables and further detailing of information (e.g., of process data) included in the main report. Teachers should be basically able to understand your case study, assumptions, data, results etc. by reading the main report only.</p><h2 id=mandatory-report-lay-out>Mandatory report lay-out</h2><p>All points below should be addressed in your final report. You can add other topics (for example, contribution analysis by life cycle phase and/or uncertainty analysis) but these need to be covered at the correct location in your report according to the ISO14040 structure and the LCA Handbook. Instructions on how to describe specific topics can be found in the LCA Handbook.</p><ol><li>Abstract (less than 300 words)</li><li>Table of contents</li><li>Course modelling requirements in a Table with process numbers and short explanation</li><li>Introduction</li><li>Goal and scope definition<br>a.

By using detailed life cycle assessment (LCA), this study compares the environmental impacts and identifies alternative ways of producing rapeseed oil and palm oil to the EU market in order to reduce environmental impacts”. […] “Some, until recently, blind spots in agricultural LCAs are (1) the identification of the marginal/actually affected crops and regions, (2) the identification of how increased demand for an agricultural product is met and (3) avoided environmental interventions from transformation of non-productive land into agricultural land (Schmidt 2008a). Relating to (1), increased demand for rapeseed in the EU <span class="highlight-text blue">may</span> lead to either increased import or increased cultivation or a combination. <span class="highlight-text blue">If</span> cultivation is increased, it is important to clarify if this affects the area cultivated with other crops in the region. For example, in Denmark where the total agricultural area has been declining in the last decades, it is <span class="highlight-text blue">likely</span> that increased cultivation of rapeseed will cause less area available for other crops. Thus, the marginal crop will be displaced. <span class="highlight-text blue">If</span> it is <span class="highlight-text blue">assumed</span> that increased production of rapeseed does not affect the overall food security in the world, the displaced crop will be compensated for in the region representing the marginal supplier of that crop. Relating to (2), it is relevant to clarify <span class="highlight-text blue">if</span> increased agricultural production is met by increased yield or by increased area, i.e. transformation of non-productive land into agricultural land. This may include intermediate crop displacement; e.g. increased rapeseed in Denmark displaces barley; this ‘missing’ barley <span class="highlight-text blue">may</span> be produced in Canada either by intensification or by expanding the agricultural land.

It is, for example, fully based on <span class="highlight-text blue">matrix algebra</span>, although the user may be unaware of that whilst using the program. This implies that process trees with <span class="highlight-text blue">a recursive flow structures</span> (steel production needing coal and coal production needing steel), provide no computational problems and are exactly solved. Moreover, the program is very flexible in dealing with <span class="highlight-text blue">allocation of multiple processes</span>. In contrast with some other programs, such processes need not be allocated prior to their entry in the database, and the allocation method (substitution, partitioning, or no allocation at all) may be defined for each individual unit process. The program also supports fully hybrid inventories, consisting of process-based and IO-based data.
