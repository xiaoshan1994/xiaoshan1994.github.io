or, perhaps, was - the largest importer by volume of American goods into China.</p><p>Those goods? Waste paper - typically with some unwelcome trash mixed in. Tonne upon tonne was baled /beɪl/, stacked on to ships and sailed to China, where workers manually sorted through it.</p><p>It is a crucial job: if waste paper is too contaminated, it cannot be recycled.</p><p>It is also a job that is hard to automate successfully. It needs humans.</p><p>So rich countries started shipping their waste to countries where workers are poor enough to sort it for wages low enough to turn a profit.</p><p>From the 1980s until very recently, this system worked smoothly.</p><p>China&rsquo;s fast-growing economy exported lots of manufactured goods, and instead of ships returning empty, they were loaded with waste for China to recycle.</p><p>Entrepreneurs such as Mrs Yin made a fortune.</p><p>But as China got richer, the government decided it no longer wanted to be a dumping ground for the world&rsquo;s trash.</p><p>It 2017, it announced its National Sword policy, under which China would only accept well-sorted rubbish containing no more than half of 1% of stuff that should not be there. That was a big change - contamination rates used to reach 40 times that.</p><p>The amount of waste being shipped to China plunged.</p><p>Governments and recycling companies scrambled to adjust.</p><p>Should they find other countries poor enough to accept their badly sorted waste, or raise taxes to pay higher-wage workers to sort it better, or do something else?</p><p>There is a reason the &ldquo;reduce, reuse, recycle&rdquo; mantra/&lsquo;mæntrə/咒语 is in that order. Rinsing and refilling glass bottles makes more sense than crushing and melting them to make new ones.</p><p>Examples of reuse go back before paper, to papyrus: Ancient Greece gave us the word &ldquo;palimpsest&rdquo;, which literally means &ldquo;scraped clean to be used again&rdquo;.</p><p>The Romans melted old bronze statues to sculpt new ones, and 1,000 years ago, Japan pulped paper to make more paper.</p><p>For centuries people have scraped a living by scavenging /ˈskævəndʒ/ for scrap, such as rags to sell to paper mills.</p><p>But that was all driven by market incentives: the raw materials were too valuable to be thrown away.</p><p>The idea that we should recycle because it is the right thing to do is much more recent.</p><p>Consider a Time magazine article from August 1955 headlined &ldquo;Throwaway Living&rdquo;. The adjective is not pejorative - it is celebratory.</p><p>&ldquo;Disposable items cut down household chores,&rdquo; it says.</p><p>A smiling family fills its bin with paper plates, plastic cutlery and other objects which, the article tells us, &ldquo;would take 40 hours to clean - except that no housewife need bother&rdquo;.</p><p>Why wash up after cooking when you can use a foil &ldquo;Disposa-pan&rdquo;, or a throwaway barbecue, complete with handy asbestos stand?</p><p>A TV ad campaign known as &ldquo;The Crying Indian&rdquo; helped shift the mood, in America at least.</p><p>First shown in 1971, it shows a Native American man paddling his canoe down a trash-polluted river, and standing by a road as a passing motorist tosses a bag of fast-food detritus at his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;People start pollution,&rdquo; runs the voiceover. &ldquo;People can stop it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Native American man turns to the camera, a single tear rolling down his cheek.</p><p>But the advert was not all it seemed, and not just because the actor turned out to be a second-generation Italian immigrant.</p><p>It was funded by an organisation backed by leading beverage and packaging companies.</p><p>At the time, deposit schemes were common: buy a fizzy drink, and get some cash back when you return the bottle. This model assumes it is the manufacturer&rsquo;s job to provide the incentives and logistics for returning waste.</p><p>The Crying Indian had a different message. People were responsible for their own waste.</p><p>Deposit schemes fell out of fashion. Recycling logistics became seen as a matter for local government.</p><p>Historian Finis Dunaway argues that turning &ldquo;big systemic problems into questions of individual responsibility&rdquo; in this way was a bad idea.</p><p>It made recycling less about effective action, more about making ourselves feel good.</p><p>That seems to chime with research by behavioural economists at Boston University, who found that people who know they can recycle tend to act more wastefully.</p><p>That would not matter if recycling was cost-free, but of course, it is not.</p><p>The economist Michael Munger also argues that it is a bad idea to leave waste disposal to the free market.</p><p>If you charge people what it costs to safely dispose of their rubbish, you tempt them to dump it illegally instead, and that is much worse.</p><p>But once we use taxes to subsidise waste disposal, we risk incentivising the behaviour in the Time magazine article - people can chuck stuff away when society bears the costs.</p><p>How do we get them to recycle instead? One solution is the moral persuasion of The Crying Indian adverts.</p><p>But that also creates a problem, says Munger, in an essay for US think tank The Cato Institute.</p><p>He says we should simply compare the costs and benefits of recycling each kind of waste - glass bottles, tin cans, plastic coffee cups etc against other options.</p><p>Well-designed landfills are nowadays pretty safe, and we can harness the methane they produce for electricity.</p><p>Modern waste incinerators can be a clean-ish source of power.</p><p>If instead we treat recycling as a moral question, when do we stop? That brings us back to the conundrum posed by China&rsquo;s National Sword policy.</p><p>Paring back recycling programmes would make sorting easier. But it seems like a backward step.</p><p>Taiwan - once dubbed &ldquo;garbage island&rdquo; - now famously has one of the highest recycling rates in the world.</p><p>How? By making sure that waste disposal &ldquo;sits firmly in the public consciousness&rdquo;, Ying-Ying Lai, head of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration&rsquo;s waste management department, told the Smithsonian Magazine.</p><p>If they can do it, why can&rsquo;t everyone else?</p><p>Perhaps we need systemic answers: maybe regulators can encourage new business models like those bottle deposit schemes making manufacturers think through the incentives and logistics for recycling their products.</p><p>Many of these discussions are happening under the voguish phrase &ldquo;the circular economy&rdquo;, a concept also cited by Taiwan&rsquo;s Ying-Ying Lai.</p><p>Or perhaps technology will come to the rescue.</p><p>One UK start-up says that it can turn mixed plastics - notoriously difficult to recycle - back into the oil from where they came.</p><p>A mall in Australia recently gave a debut to an artificial intelligence-enabled trash can which senses what is put in it, and sorts it accordingly.</p><p>State-of-the-art sorting facilities use robots, lasers, magnets and air jets to separate different recyclable streams.</p><p>None of this can yet compete with the scale of the work done by low-cost labourers in China and beyond - but maybe closing off that option will prove just the spur to innovation that the industry needs.</p><h1 id=whats-holding-up-scotlands-bottle-deposit-scheme>What&rsquo;s holding up Scotland&rsquo;s bottle deposit scheme?</h1><p><a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48198098>BBC</a><br>17 November 2021</p><p>Scotland&rsquo;s bottle return scheme seems likely to suffer further days, with the Scottish government blaming Covid-19, Brexit and a row over tax rules.</p><p>The scheme will add 20p to the price of products sold in some plastic drinking containers, cans and glass with the money being refunded when the containers are returned.</p><p>The government originally outlined its plans in 2017, saying it represented &ldquo;a step change in our level of ambition&rdquo; for recycling</p><p>Ministers had originally hoped the scheme would start in April 2021, but this was pushed back to July 2022, with the government blaming the pandemic.</p><p>It is now widely expected to be delayed again after Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater told MSPs that a number of other issues were holding up the system, including Brexit.</p><p>She also claimed there had been a &ldquo;lack of clarity&rdquo; from the UK government over the tax status of the 20p deposits.</p><p>Ms Slater insisted that the government remains fully committed to implementing the scheme - but would not give a timescale for when it would actually happen.</p><p>Environmental group Greenpeace has been critical of the government, saying that a further delay would mean &ldquo;millions more cans and bottles needlessly dumped and burned&rdquo;.</p><p>And opposition parties have said it as an example of the government&rsquo;s environmental rhetoric not being matched by its actions.</p><p>What type of containers will be included in the scheme?<br>The scheme will apply to all types of drinks in containers between 50ml and three litres in size.</p><p>Glass containers have been included in the scheme, despite some criticism from the glass industry.</p><p>Reality Check: Is this how to cut plastic waste?<br>The Scottish government has said that HDPE-made plastic bottles, which are typically used to carry milk, will not be included.</p><p>However, containers made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) - which typically carry fizzy drinks and water - will be subject to the deposit return.</p><p>How will it work?<br>Effectively, 20p - the deposit - will be added to the price of a single-use drinks container bought from a shop.</p><p>The consumer will get their deposit back when they return the empty bottle or can to the retailer.</p><p>The scheme will operate throughout Scotland, including rural areas and all retail outlets will have to comply, regardless of size.</p><p>Businesses selling drinks which are opened and consumed on site - such as pubs and restaurants - will not have to charge the deposit to the public.</p><p>How will I get my deposit back?<br>There will be two ways you can return your empty container - over the counter, or by using a reverse vending machine (RVM).</p><p>An RVM is a machine that scans containers when they are returned and then refunds your deposit.</p><p>The government says there will be a range of ways you can get your 20p back, for example cash at a till, a token or discount voucher or digitally. The returned containers are stored in the machine and are then collected for recycling.</p><p>As well as retailers and hospitality businesses, schools and other community hubs will be able to act as return locations.</p><p>Who will be in charge of this scheme?<br>The government says an independent, privately-run, not-for-profit company will be in charge.</p><p>It adds that the system will be paid for through three sources of funding - unredeemed deposits, revenue from the sale of materials and a producer fee.</p><p><img src=https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C0ED/production/_100598394_datapic-uk_plastic-j3a89-nc.png alt=Bottles></p><p>Is this also happening in the rest of the UK?<br>Scotland could still be the first nation in the UK to introduce a bottle deposit return scheme as recycling is a devolved issue.</p><p>A consultation on the introduction of a similar scheme in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was carried out by the UK government last year.</p><p>A four-week pilot for a deposit return scheme was recently run in Conwy in north Wales.</p><h1 id=what-are-microplastics>What are microplastics?</h1><p><a href=https://www.ecomatters.nl/news/restriction-on-intentionally-added-microplastics/>https://www.ecomatters.nl/news/restriction-on-intentionally-added-microplastics/</a></p><p><img src=https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/Microplastics%20in%20house%20dust%20%28%40%20Dick.Vethaak%29%20klein.jpg alt></p><ul><li>Microplastics are solid plastic particles composed of polymers and functional additives less than 5 millimetres in size.</li><li>Already, microplastics have been found in almost all marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems as well as in food and drinking water.</li><li>Current bans mainly focus on the application of scrubbing microbeads in cosmetics.
