Confronting the trade in plastic waste is also <span class="highlight-text blue">an issue of climate justice</span>, as the by-products aggravate health and environmental harms in lower-income countries and among communities that lack the political leverage to reject this waste.</p><h1 id=1-executive-summary>1. Executive Summary</h1><ul><li>Now, <span class="highlight-text blue">South East Asia</span> has become by far the largest recipient of waste from Europe and North America as well as from Australia.</li><li>In addition, the role of <span class="highlight-text blue">African countries</span> as receiving destinations is growing for both <span class="highlight-text blue">the North American and European waste trade</span>.</li><li>Plastic waste, that once processed, becomes raw material to be sold to manufacturing companies. However, many of these receiving countries only possess basic recycling facilities and therefore are unable to process <span class="highlight-text blue">mixed or hazardous waste</span>, which is eventually <span class="highlight-text blue">dumped or burnt</span>.</li><li>The populations of developing and emerging economies in Africa and Asia are the most affected, and workers in those countries have to contend with <span class="highlight-text blue">unsanitary and exploitative working conditions</span> in sorting and recycling plants.</li><li>Legitimate recycling companies and waste brokers have engaged in the <span class="highlight-text blue">misdeclaration</span> of the content of containers and their origin; the <span class="highlight-text blue">concealment</span> of illicit waste among other goods; <span class="highlight-text blue">illegal dumping and incineration</span>; and money<br>laundering and corruption to <span class="highlight-text blue">circumvent</span> import and export bans and regulations.</li><li>Often with stops in other parts of the world such as Turkey or eastern Europe.</li><li>Although many European countries have advanced recycling facilities, they cannot handle all of the waste produced domestically.</li></ul><h1 id=2-waste-colonialism-and-exploitation>2. WASTE COLONIALISM AND EXPLOITATION</h1><p>However, like all other highly lucrative businesses, waste management has long attracted the attention of criminals and of legitimate business operators adopting fraudulent practices such as misdeclaring the content of containers, money laundering, financial crime and corruption to maximize their profits.</p><h2 id=the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</h2><ul><li>The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a sharp rise in the consumption of single-use plastic, from <span class="highlight-text blue">medical equipment</span> to <span class="highlight-text blue">takeaway food packaging</span>, which has not been matched by increased recycling capacity.</li><li>In 2020, the US produced a year’s worth of plastic waste in just two months. And in Thailand, generation of plastic waste jumped by 50% following the outbreak, with food-delivery packaging representing a sizeable share.</li><li>Meanwhile, as the pandemic took hold, the recycling sector was affected by disruptions, staff shortages and a deprioritization of recycling.</li><li>The world registered a 280% increase in illegal plastic-waste disposal in 2020. UK seeing a 300% increase in so-called fly-tipping (illegal dumping)</li></ul><h1 id=3-legal-framework>3. LEGAL FRAMEWORK</h1><p>Two types of illegal activities related to waste: illegal trade,<br>which violates import or export bans; and illegal treatment, in the forms of illegal disposal, incineration or recycling.</p><h2 id=international-conventions>International conventions</h2><ul><li>The Basel Convention was adopted in 1989 in response to developing regions being used as dumping grounds for foreign waste in the 1980s.</li><li>To date, 187 countries and the European Union (EU) are parties to it; notably, the US is not among them.</li><li>European Commission adopted a new set of rules in December 2020. EU countries can now only export to non-OECD destinations <span class="highlight-text blue">‘clean plastic waste’</span> for recycling and are banned from shipping <span class="highlight-text blue">hazardous or hard-to-recycle plastic waste</span> to non-OECD countries.</li><li>Export activities considered illegal in Europe are compliant with US legislation.</li></ul><h2 id=illegal-traffic-under-the-basel-convention>Illegal traffic under the Basel Convention</h2><h2 id=chinas-national-sword-policy>China’s ‘National Sword’ policy</h2><p>As a result of the ban, countries such as <span class="highlight-text blue">Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines</span>, along with many others, became the new recycling destinations for most North American and European plastic waste, despite the fact they often lacked adequate disposal facilities and sufficient law enforcement capacity.</p><h2 id=other-national-level-bans-and-the-trend-in-u-turns>Other national-level bans and the trend in U-turns</h2><blockquote><p>For example, in July 2021, largely compelled by a Greenpeace investigation that uncovered that most imported plastic waste was not recycled, <strong>Turkey</strong> introduced a ban on the imports of PET, HDPE and LDPE plastics. However, in less than two weeks, PET was removed from the list of banned imports. The move was symptomatic of the tensions between the country’s ministry of environment wanting a total ban and the ministry of trade advocating for openness, and is the by-product of the narrative that, at times of financial crisis, waste management and processing are needed to generate revenue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In <strong>Thailand</strong>, plans to ban imports of plastic waste by September 2020 were postponed by five years, with critics arguing that this was aimed at securing a steady flow of waste needed to feed Thailand’s recycling industry, driven by an ever-growing number of Chinese companies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Following a 2019 ban on all waste imports, <strong>Indonesia</strong> also softened its stance. The year after, the government allowed the imports of plastic (and paper) waste with contamination levels of up to 2%. This particular case highlights the role of one particular set of actors: trade associations. The US Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) openly lobbied for the continuation of imports of a number of waste materials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If these requests are met, <strong>Kenya</strong> – which has the strictest ban on single-use plastics in the world34 – could become the main hub for the distribution of US-made plastic in the continent.</p></blockquote><h1 id=4-human-and-environmental-harm>4. HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HARM</h1><ul><li>Much of the waste that is exported for recycling to South East Asia is often burned or dumped.</li><li>The degree to which the illicit trade in plastic waste severely undermines both the natural environment and human health and safety is alarming.</li><li>All this waste eventually feeds the five infamous garbage patches that float in our oceans, of which the so-called <span class="highlight-text blue">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</span> is the largest.</li><li>Aside from dumping, it has become common practice to burn illicit waste as a method of disposal in Indonesia or Malaysia, causing <span class="highlight-text blue">air pollution, respiratory problems, and food health problems (ashes)</span>.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Burning is also used as a method of illicit waste disposal in some European countries such as <strong>Italy</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong>, as well as in <strong>Turkey</strong>. In October 2021, Italian authorities arrested the owners of a recycling plant who, in 2017, set ablaze tonnes of mixed hazardous waste as a way of clearing their premises at no cost.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In <strong>Turkey</strong>, an average of two suspicious incinerations per week take place at recycling plants.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The exploitation of vulnerable workers has also been documented in <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where some companies systematically employ women to sort waste (with no concerns for any resulting health problems).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ghana</strong>’s Environmental Protection Agency told the GI-TOC that most recycling facilities in the country (primarily owned by <strong>Chinese entrepreneurs</strong>) have unsanitary working conditions. A similar picture emerged in <strong>Zambia</strong>, where Chinese companies appear to underpay their workers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In <strong>Indonesia</strong> and the <strong>Philippines</strong>, waste pickers and workers in collection and aggregation facilities generally do not have formal employment contracts with the owners of the facilities and thus lack access to basic benefits, training and protections vital to their safety. Most waste pickers also do not have identification documents, a prerequisite for accessing government health-insurance schemes.</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-great-pacific-garbage-patch>THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH</h2><p>46% of the total mass is made of <span class="highlight-text blue">discarded fishing gear</span>.</p><h1 id=5-tracing-the-flows>5. TRACING THE FLOWS</h1><ul><li>Illicit plastic waste is transported around the world along multiple routes from <span class="highlight-text blue">North America</span> and <span class="highlight-text blue">Europe</span> to <span class="highlight-text blue">South East Asia</span>, <span class="highlight-text blue">other parts of Asia</span> and <span class="highlight-text blue">Africa</span>.</li><li><span class="highlight-text blue">Turkey</span> has become a key node for the trade in European plastic waste owing to its permissive environment, an appetite for receiving and processing foreign waste to <span class="highlight-text blue">generate revenue</span> and <span class="highlight-text blue">the presence of criminal groups</span>.</li><li>Underlying drivers：1. the US and the EU simply do not have sufficient capacity to recycle domestically；2. The cost of exporting waste abroad is dramatically lower than the cost of setting up new facilities.</li><li><span class="highlight-text orange">More compelling economic consideration is that producing virgin plastic is often more affordable than its recycled equivalent.</span> (the global plastics-recycling market is going to struggle to be competitive in the face of cheaper and often better-quality raw plastic.)</li></ul><blockquote><p>Crucially, the shale gas boom in the US is driving the cheap production of fossil fuels, including gases such as ethylene and propylene, which are the two most important plastic feedstocks.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Where next? Eastern Europe (specifically <span class="highlight-text blue">Romania</span> and <span class="highlight-text blue">Bulgaria</span>) could be a potential destination. <span class="highlight-text blue">Laos</span> or <span class="highlight-text blue">Myanmar</span>, where there have already been some detections, should be ones to watch. Looking further into the future, flows towards <span class="highlight-text blue">African countries (Zambia)</span> are likely to increase.</li></ul><blockquote><p>According to <strong>Romanian</strong> authorities, organized crime groups are involved in the illicit trade of hazardous and unrecyclable plastics. <strong>Poland</strong> also receives waste from EU countries and the UK that is misdeclared as ‘recyclable’ (already sorted plastic that is, in fact, mixed with banned waste) and ends up being illegally dumped or burnt.</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-in-betweens>The in-betweens</h2><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/152579198-c750a73b-802e-47a9-a187-d43ed686199f.png alt=image></p><table><thead><tr><th>Origin</th><th>Destination</th><th>Transit</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Canada</td><td>Indonesia</td><td></td><td>Indonesia has returned waste to Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>Malaysia</td><td></td><td>Butterworth, Canada’s second-largest port, has been identified as a main departure hub for illegal plastic waste from the country to South East Asia.

Mislabelling to be compliant with the Basel Convention (disguising imports under a different customs code as customs officers can only inspect a fraction of containers going through ports each day); 2. Recycling companies sometimes misdeclare their operating capacity, inflating their ability to recycle plastic waste in order to be allowed to import it (Malaysia and Vietnam).</p><p>Concealment: Hiding plastic waste in the middle of other waste products such as paper and e-waste that are not subject to the same level of scrutiny (legal loophole).</p><ul><li><strong>Recycling and other companies</strong>: Chinese companies found new homes in Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana (lacked adequate machinery for recycling which raises suspicion that waste would be dumped in the country) and Zambia (competition among the ever-growing companies is fierce, which increases the prices of plastic waste)</li></ul><p>![image](<a href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/152691379-274ca41c-0250-4f42-ac47-91c8a411f7a6.png>https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65668613/152691379-274ca41c-0250-4f42-ac47-91c8a411f7a6.png</a></p><p><span class="highlight-text blue">Eastern Europe</span> as the next tile to fall in the domino effect of the ‘National Sword’ policy.</p><ul><li><strong>The ‘professional’ criminals</strong>: <span class="highlight-text blue">Turkey and eastern Europe</span>.</li></ul><h1 id=7-conclusions-and-recommendation>7.
